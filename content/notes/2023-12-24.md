I have a list of two items:

- Absorbed Aimlessnes: which relates to importance of being aimless while still working engaged in a powerful purpose, like the flow state in psychology
- Curious and Embracing Acceptance: which is about to take the good and bad and not just accept it but embrace it, such as to accept suffering and to embrace it as the fuel that enables our compassion

I now want to add a third concept, that is about the divinity of existence and non duality. Can you make suggestions? Please draw from the thinking of thich nath hanh, Anthony de Mello and Alan Watts.


Certainly! Based on the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, Anthony de Mello, and Alan Watts, all of whom explored concepts of divinity and non-duality in their works, here is a suggestion for a third concept that aligns with your list:

- Unified Divine Presence: This concept reflects the idea that divinity permeates all aspects of existence, transcending the illusion of separation. It is about recognizing the interconnectedness of all things and understanding that at the deepest level, there is no "self" and "other," but rather a continuous fabric of being. This awareness leads to an experience of oneness with the universe, akin to what many describe as enlightenment or awakening.

Drawing from each thinker:

- Thich Nhat Hanh often spoke about "interbeing," which is the notion that everything in the universe is interconnected. The Unified Divine Presence would encompass this understanding by recognizing that we are not separate from each other or from any part of existence; rather, we are part of a magnificent whole.

- Anthony de Mello emphasized awareness and waking up to reality as it is. In this context, Unified Divine Presence would involve awakening to the divine reality that underlies all appearances and forms, seeing beyond dualistic perceptions to appreciate the sacredness inherent in every moment and every entity.

- Alan Watts discussed non-duality extensively, particularly through his interpretation of Eastern philosophy for Western audiences. He often conveyed the idea that life is a play (Lila) in which we are both spectators and participants. The Unified Divine Presence embodies this playful aspect of existence where one recognizes themselves as an expression of the divine dance without getting caught up in artificial distinctions between subject and object.

Together, these perspectives form a holistic view where aimlessness becomes purposeful (Absorbed Aimlessness), acceptance becomes embracing (Curious and Embracing Acceptance), and individuality becomes unity (Unified Divine Presence).
