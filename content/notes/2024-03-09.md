I loved [The City of Brass](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426419883) also by Chakraborty. Never got into reading the other books in the trilogy though, since I only picked up the second installment after a long break, and it was difficult for me to find my footing as to what was going on. 

So I thought a new series by the same author would be ideal for me, and I was very happy that this was excellent.

This is well and truly and adventure novel. It transports us into a different time and world, and we get to follow the exploits of a bunch of third rate pirates.

I really appreciated the rich world, filled with detail that was clearly based on mountains of research. Specifically around seafaring and the lives of pirates in this corner of the world.

Otherwise the writing is so full of wit and effortlessly paces the story along.

I also liked the way magic is described here. As something really dangerous that one better leaves ones fingers off on. This theme is weaved through the narrative quite powerfully.

>My own life had taught me that true magic is rare, much rarer than people would believe, but also deadlier.

Change the following to HTML

I enjoyed [The City of Brass](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426419883) by S.A. Chakraborty, but I didn't continue with the trilogy. It was hard to jump back in after a break. So when the author started a new series, I was eager to give it a try, and I'm glad I did—it's excellent.

_The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi_ is truly an swashbuckling adventure. It takes us to the Arabian Sea and Red Sea in the middle ages, where we join a group of not-so-famous pirates on their journey.

It's clear that Chakraborty has done mountains of seafaring and pirate life in this part of history, and the rich detail woven through almost every page contributes a lot to making all the places and people come to live.

The writing is sharp and witty, making the story flow smoothly.

What stands out as well is how magic is portrayed—dangerous and better left alone. This idea runs through the book strongly:

>My own life had taught me that true magic is rare, much rarer than people would believe, but also deadlier.

In short, this book is a thrilling ride through a richly detailed world with adventure and danger lurking around every corner.

## Quotes

Put this program into action, a thousand times: (a) identify the negative feelings in you; (b) understand that they are in you, not in the world, not in external reality; (c) do not see them as an essential part of “I”; these things come and go; (d) understand that when you change, everything changes.
We see things and people not as they are, but as we are.
Happiness does not depend on what you have or who you are, it solely relies on what you think.
It is not by your actions that you will be saved” (or awakened; call it by any word you want), “but by your being. It is not by what you do, but by what you are that you will be judged.”
Can the knife cut itself? Can the tooth bite itself? Can the eye see itself? Can the ‘I’ know itself?
When you’re ready to lose your life, you live it.
“If the eye is unobstructed, it results in sight; if the ear is unobstructed, the result is hearing; if the nose is unobstructed, the result is a sense of smell; if the mouth is unobstructed, the result is a sense of taste; if the mind is unobstructed, the result is wisdom.” […] I would add another sentence to the ones I’ve read: “If the heart is unobstructed, the result is love.”
When you cut water, the water doesn’t get hurt; when you cut something solid, it breaks. You’ve got solid attitudes inside you; you’ve got solid illusions inside you; that’s what bumps against nature, that’s where you get hurt, that’s where the pain comes from.
The knowledge and skill you have achieved are after all meant to be “forgotten” so you can float in emptiness without obstruction and comfortably. Learning is important, but do not become its slave. Above all, do not harbor anything external or superfluous; the mind is the primary.
A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions--as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all.
Mindfulness lets us break the stream of thoughts that might otherwise lead to wallowing in misery, by changing our relationship to thought itself. Instead of being swept away by that stream we can pause and see that these are just thoughts—and choose whether or not to act on them.
With equanimity, you can deal with situations with calm and reason while keeping your inner happiness.
reality is whole, but words and concepts fragment reality.
In fact, Thomas Aquinas (he’s not only a theologian but also a great philosopher) says repeatedly, “All the efforts of the human mind cannot exhaust the essence of a single fly.”
