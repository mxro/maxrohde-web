Please help me write my article, Book Review: Anthony de Mello - Awareness. I provide you with notes what all should be included in the article and I'll ask you to draft the article from these notes, following them as much as possible.

Also keep in mind
- use plain understandable language and use simple words when possible (not: panacea, better: cure all)
- be concise (not: As we close this book review, it's clear that "Awareness" is not for the faint-hearted. better: "Awareness is not for the faint-hearted"; not: He puts it powerfully when he says: better: He says:)
- use short sentences
- avoid unnecessary words
- avoid repetition
- ensure there is a good flow between sentences and paragraphs
- try to explain a lot with only a few, simple word.
- be conversational but not too casual
- avoid pathos and fluffy language (not: penned, better: written)
- Respond in British English only.
- Include all quotes provided and contextual information
- Never output headings as bold text (`**`), instead output them as Markdown headings, starting with level 2 heading (`##`)
