Book review for 'The Pragmatist's Guide to Life: A Guide to Creating Your Own Answers to Life's Biggest Questions' by Malcolm Collins;Simone Collins

The central premise of the book is that we should be very purposeful in what we value. We should establish that first and from there then determine how we want to live our lives.

The authors call this, somewhat technically, the objective function. It is defined as something we want to maximize. For instance, you may decide that your life's purpose is to maximize human well-being or your own enjoyment.

After you have established that, you can then choose your ideologies. For instance, you may choose to believe that communism is the best way to advance collective human well-being.

The book concludes what can be best described as a psychological toolbox that provides ways in which we can mold ourselves into the self that we need to be to implement our objective function and be in alignment with our ideologies.

I think there's a lot of truth to the importance of living our lives purposefully rather than on autopilot, where we choose what we value at random. However, the approach described in the pragmatist's guide to life feels a bit cold and clinical to me. I don't think there's any way for us to objectively determine what has value or what is good and bad. Thus I question the desire to describe what we intrinsically value with mathematical precision.

I actually found the letter part of the book to be the most valuable. It contains a lot of boilerplate self-help advice, but overall it's a decent collection.


Book Review for 'The Pragmatist's Guide to Life: A Guide to Creating Your Own Answers to Life's Biggest Questions' by Malcolm and Simone Collins

At the heart of this book is the concept that we ought to be intentional about our values. The authors suggest that we first clarify what matters most to us, and then shape our lives accordingly.

They refer to this as the 'objective function', a term they use to describe a goal we aim to maximise, such as enhancing human well-being or personal enjoyment.

Once our core values are in place, we can align our beliefs and ideologies with them. For example, one might adopt communism as a means to promote collective well-being.

The book culminates in what could be termed a psychological toolkit, offering strategies for shaping ourselves into individuals who can fulfil our objective function and adhere to our chosen ideologies.

While I agree that living intentionally is crucial, rather than drifting through life without direction, I find the method outlined in 'The Pragmatist's Guide to Life' somewhat impersonal. The suggestion that we can measure what we value with mathematical accuracy seems unrealistic; values are inherently subjective.

I found the latter part of the book most beneficial. Despite its tendency towards generic self-help advice, it presents a solid compilation of guidance for personal development.

## Joyful

Book review for 'Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness' by [Ingrid Fetell Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16834389.Ingrid_Fetell_Lee)

I was brought up in the grey, efficient world of Northern Europe. We do not appreciate waste and flimsy. Thus, I think Joyful was the perfect book for me.

It goes against my deeply held belief that the mind reigns supreme and that we should supersede the restrictions and demands of the material world.

Joyful makes a compelling case that I'm wrong. It cites plenty of research that the material things in our life can have a great impact on our happiness and well-being. If we live in places that look happy, we become happy.

Unfortunately, our world is shaped by people just like me. We have white walls and boxy buildings. We wear grey clothes and only have sensible objects in our homes.

It should come as no surprise that this is not always a wellspring of joy and happiness for us, since it is far removed from the natural environment for which we have been genetically designed.

Fetell Lee suggests a number of principles we can adhere to, to shape the material world that surrounds us in a more joyful way:

- Energy: Add colour and non-rectangular shapes
- Abundance: Don't be stingy in filling your spaces, e.g. plentyful pot plants
- Freedom: Don't constrain yourself in your spaces
- Harmony: Bring visual harmony by using repeating patterns and themes
- Play: Encourage play
- Surprise: Keep your spaces unpredictable
- Transcendence: Place things high up and have them raising
- Magic: Embrace the supernatural

I think there are a lot of contradictions in the presented principles, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Since this should not stop oneself from picking and choosing what works best.

 Book Review for 'Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness' by Ingrid Fetell Lee

Raised in the grey, efficient climes of Northern Europe, where waste and frivolity are frowned upon, I found 'Joyful' to be an eye-opening read.

This book challenges my deeply ingrained belief that the mind should always triumph over the material world's constraints and demands.

In 'Joyful', Ingrid Fetell Lee presents a persuasive argument that contradicts my views, drawing on extensive research to demonstrate how our surroundings significantly influence our happiness and well-being. She posits that living in environments that exude joy can, in turn, make us joyful.

Regrettably, our environments are often shaped by individuals like myself: white walls, boxy architecture, grey attire, and homes filled only with practical items. It's hardly surprising that such settings do not serve as founts of joy and happiness since they diverge from the natural habitats we are genetically attuned to.

Fetell Lee outlines several principles for infusing our material world with joy:

- Energy: Introduce vibrant colours and varied shapes.
- Abundance: Generously populate your spaces; consider plentiful pot plants.
- Freedom: Allow room for movement within your spaces.
- Harmony: Create visual harmony with repeating patterns and themes.
- Play: Foster a sense of playfulness.
- Surprise: Incorporate elements of unpredictability.
- Transcendence: Elevate objects to give a sense of ascension.
- Magic: Welcome elements of the supernatural or extraordinary.

Admittedly, there are contradictions within these principles. However, this should not deter anyone from selecting what resonates most with them.
