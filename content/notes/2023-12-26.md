## Prompt 1

Create the narration for a yoga practice, it should include at least 10 poses. Start with prompts to encourage mindful breathing. Then mention the philosophical underpinnings of yoga, namely that mind, body and spirit are the same.

For each position give the name of the position but also explain the spiritual meaning behind them using the following reference:
## Anjali Mudra

anjalimudra200x200.jpgProbably the most common and easily identifiable [mudra](http://www.chopra.com/articles/10-powerful-mudras-and-how-to-use-them), prayer position can happen in just about any pose. Most yogis are familiar with this mudra as an indicator of gratitude, respect, or prayer, but try this subtle shift to get more out of it: rather than pressing the palms flat against each other, cup your hands ever so slightly. This creates a small space between your palms, into which you mentally and energetically place the seed of your intention or prayer. Holding that small space consciously creates space for blessings to enter your heart and your life. 
## Mountain Pose

_mountain200x200.jpgTadasana_ is the foundation for all standing poses. It is solid, stable, and profound—as you yourself can be when you inhabit all the possibilities of this posture. When you want to feel grounded and balanced, you can envision yourself _as_ the mountain—standing tall, steady, and expansive. When want to connect to your potential, and the vastness of the possibilities ahead (in your practice, day, or life), you can see yourself as standing on _top_ of the mountain. With your third eye, envision the clouds, the birds, the treetops out beyond you and below you. Everything is possible in this pose, and if you’ve ever done Mountain pose ON a mountain, then you’ve tasted the majesty available to you.  

This pose might seem simple, but its meaning and symbolism run deeper than you think. In Sanskrit, this pose is known as [Tadasana](https://www.yogabasics.com/asana/mountain/), with ‘tada’ meaning mountain and ‘asana’ meaning posture. The mountain pose is also known as the Samasthiti which is derived from the word “Sama,” that means upright and unmoving and “Sthiti” which means still and steady. This pose is the foundation for all [standing poses](https://www.yogabasics.com/practice/yoga-postures/standing-yoga-poses/ "standing poses") and evokes stillness, strength, stability, and power, just like a mountain.

Most people don’t pay enough attention to the way they stand, and overtime many develop an imbalance in the hips and spine. This pose works to create a lightness in the body, serves to ground us down to earth, and invites a steady energy into the body.
## Tree Pose

tree.jpg_Vrksasana_ gives you a chance to align with the beauty and wisdom of nature by encouraging you to extend your roots downward, while reaching your limbs and heart upward toward something higher. The shape of the pose calls for a strong standing leg (tree trunk), and the dispersion of energy asks you to be both steady and flexible. If a strong wind tries to blow you over in this pose, rigidity can cause a limb to break. Going _with_ the wind, while staying rooted in your power, will help you to dance with grace no matter what comes your way.  
  
## Eagle Pose

eagle200x200.jpgThe Eagle is a strong and regal bird, and is known in various myths as one of God’s messengers. As you sit deeply into the pose, you can imagine yourself flying between the earthly and spiritual planes, with an Eagle Eye that takes in the greater perspective of life. _Garudasana_ (or Eagle pose) demands great focus and patience, as does living a life in accordance with Spirit. It can be easy to get bogged down with the challenges of life (or of this pose!), but a calm connection with the Divine can help you soar on your journey.  

This yoga pose’s symbol is right there in its name. The eagle is a regal bird known for its strength and various myths as a messenger of God. As you sit in the pose, you can visualize yourself taking flight between spiritual and earthly planes. Your new eagle eye of the world should take in a greater life perspective as just one of the many great benefits of practicing yoga.

[Eagle pose](https://www.yogabasics.com/asana/eagle/) requires great focus and a lot of patience. Think of it like this: getting stuck on all the negative challenges or difficulties of life may be easy, much like how difficult this pose can be at first, but a calmness and the right amount of focus can help you on your journey. Eagle Pose helps us to see what is important in life.
## Crane

Another bird-inspired pose, _Bakasana_, or Crane pose, can help bakasana.jpgyou to sharpen your vision while balancing atop life’s challenges. In order to successfully support yourself in this pose, you must keep your eyes fixed on a point out ahead of you or you may collapse. The crane must also focus its eyes into the murky and shallow waters before taking its next step; it must focus sharply on its prey, but do so with a quiet sense of poise. Bring more focus to your _Drishti_ (focused gaze) the next time you do _Bakasana_, and feel yourself pierce through the murkiness ahead with your focused efforts and willingness.  
## Cobra

bhujangasana.jpgAnd then there is the cobra, which sheds its skin and returns renewed and refreshed. The cobra has no arms so it uses its strong spine to lift its head. Engage your back to lift your heart when you’re in this pose, and consider it an opportunity to transform fear into love. Just as the cobra sheds its dead layers, you, too, can shed your limiting beliefs and thoughts that prevent you from living in a strong and heart-centered way.  
## Anjaneyasana

This beautiful and graceful lunge is a full body prayer all in one anjaneyasana.jpgmovement. Reaching your arms toward the Source that unites you with all of creation, you stretch your fingers to release any expectations, judgments, and unwillingness to accept whatever the experience may have to offer. By back bending over your back leg, you open your heart to the potential of divine connection. And with your strong legs supporting you, you drive your pelvis forward on the path ahead.  
## Hanumanasana

This pose gives you the chance to take a leap of faith, just like yoga.jpgHanuman did in the Indian epic, the _Ramayana_. When leaping from one place to another, there is no turning back once you’ve launched off the edge. Courage, faith, and remembrance of your true Divine nature will get you there, if you position yourself in the direction you want to go. Your leap may be a movement _away_ from something you wish to leave behind, but is always a gesture _toward_ where you want to land. Get clear about your destination and point your heart toward it.  
## Happy Baby

Here is a sweet reminder to cultivate joyful appreciation of the happy-baby.jpgsimple things in life. In _Ananda Balasana_, or Happy Baby, you return to an innocent state of being, when you were delighted and entertained by holding your own feet! Find softness in your hips and back (babies are naturally so flexible), and hold space for appreciation in your heart as you gently rock from side to side.  
  
## Savasana

Corpse pose can easily sound morbid, but when viewed as a savasana-2.jpgsymbol for the circle of life, it is deeply healing and rejuvenating to your mind, body, and spirit. As you lay down on your back, imagine letting all the dead parts of yourself fall away. Bring the energy of an exhalation to your _Savasana_, and then reawaken with the energy of an inhalation. Sometimes the surrender required for a good _Savasana_ is the [hardest part of the practice](http://www.chopra.com/articles/why-savasana-is-the-hardest-yoga-pose), but you get better at it with practice. Each day, the sun sets, the flowers close their petals, and the birds quiet their song. Practice rest every day, and honor your natural rhythms.  
  
## Child's Pose (Balasana)

If you've ever felt your stress melt away during a seated forward fold, that's because these poses symbolize release and surrender. While standing poses ignite the flame of action in us, folding postures are about finding peace and acceptance of what is.

[Child's pose](https://www.livestrong.com/article/13776982-childs-pose-yoga-guide/), for example, isn't just about taking a childlike position. Rather, the spiritual meaning of child's pose has more to do with the vulnerability of a child, who requires nurturing and a safe place to rest their head.

As you fold forward in child's pose with your arms beside you and your forehead resting on the mat, the ground (or earth) is your support, and the muscles of your neck, back and shoulders (common sites of stress) can soften and release.

Folding postures create space between the vertebra in your spine, which creates a sense of relaxation in your nervous system and muscles. For this reason, they're most well-known for helping with stress and anxiety.

Welcome, dear yogis, to this sacred space where we unite mind, body, and spirit through the ancient practice of yoga. As we begin our journey today, I invite you to find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes gently and bring your hands together in Anjali Mudra at your heart center. Allow a slight cupping between your palms as if cradling the seed of your intention. With each breath, feel gratitude and respect blossoming within this space.

Now let us rise into Mountain Pose, Tadasana. Stand firm and rooted like the mountain itself. Feel the earth beneath you providing stability as you reach skyward with the crown of your head. Embrace the stillness and power within you as you stand tall and expansive.

Transitioning from earth to sky, lift one foot and place it on your inner thigh or calf for Tree Pose, Vrksasana. Like a tree, ground yourself with strong roots while reaching towards spiritual growth with your branches. Embrace flexibility in thought and movement as you balance here.

Next, prepare for Eagle Pose, Garudasana. Wrap one leg over the other and intertwine your arms in front of you. In this pose, channel the eagle's vision to see beyond life's immediate challenges to a broader spiritual perspective.

Now let us embody another bird with Crane Pose, Bakasana. Place your hands firmly on the mat as you lift into balance on bent arms. Keep a steady gaze—a Drishti—to maintain focus amidst life’s murky waters.

Gently lower yourself onto your abdomen for Cobra Pose. As you peel away layers of fear with each breath, lift through your spine like a cobra shedding its skin for renewal.

Rise into Anjaneyasana by stepping one foot forward into a lunge and reaching skyward with open palms. This is an act of surrendering to divine connection while maintaining strength in our earthly foundation.

Prepare now for Hanumanasana—a leap of faith mirroring Hanuman's devotion in the Ramayana. Extend one leg forward and one back as far as comfortable—embrace courage and faith in both physical stretch and spiritual journey.

Let us now return to innocence with Happy Baby Pose—Ananda Balasana—lying on our backs grasping our feet with joyous hearts as we rock side to side.

As we approach closure of our practice today, lay down gently into Savasana—the Corpse Pose—and let go of all that no longer serves you; rest deeply in this symbolic gesture of life’s natural cycles.

Finally, draw knees towards chest and roll forward into Child's Pose—Balasana—with forehead resting softly on earth; surrender here like a child seeking solace and peace amidst life’s storms.

In these poses lies not just physical alignment but also spiritual symbolism—the unity between mind, body, spirit is reflected in every movement; every breath is an affirmation that we are whole beings connected to something greater than ourselves.

Carry this wholeness with you as we seal our practice together today with another Anjali Mudra at heart center—honoring ourselves, each other, and the universe that binds us all together in grace.
Namaste.

Provide instructions for the yoga palm tree pose, starting with the deeper meaning of the position and then go through step by step instructions. Write this in a way that it will work as spoken instructions during a yoga practice that also includes other exercises that will happen before and after.

Welcome to your practice. Today, we'll be exploring the Palm Tree Pose, also known as Tadasana or Mountain Pose in its extended variation. This pose is a symbol of grace and resilience, much like a palm tree that stands tall and firm, yet flexible enough to sway with the winds without breaking. It teaches us to root down through our feet, reach high with our aspirations, and maintain balance in the face of life's challenges.

Let's begin.

Stand tall at the top of your mat with your feet together or hip-width apart for more stability. Feel the earth beneath your soles and ground yourself firmly into this space.

Close your eyes for a moment and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, imagine any tension melting away from your body.

Now, let's open our eyes and bring awareness to our posture. Engage your thigh muscles slightly by drawing them up. Tuck your tailbone under just a touch to lengthen your lower back.

Inhale deeply as you circle sweep your arms out to the sides and overhead. Bring your palms together in prayer position above you if it's comfortable for your shoulders; otherwise, keep them shoulder-width apart.

As you reach up with your hands, press down through all four corners of both feet. Feel this oppositional energy as you stretch upwards while rooting downwards—like a palm tree reaching for the sun while anchored firmly in the sand.

If it feels right for you today, lift onto the balls of your feet, coming onto your tiptoes. Keep breathing steadily as you balance here, imagining yourself growing taller with each breath cycle.

Hold this pose for several deep breaths—inhaling strength and stability, exhaling any doubt or instability.

To release from Palm Tree Pose, slowly lower your heels back down if they are lifted. Then gently float your arms back down by your sides on an exhale.

Stand quietly for a moment in Tadasana—Mountain Pose—and reflect on how you feel after embodying the qualities of the palm tree: rooted yet reaching ever skyward.

Remember that yoga is not just about achieving perfect poses but about finding balance within ourselves. Carry this sense of groundedness and aspiration with you as we continue our practice today. Namaste.

 The Palm Tree Pose, known as Tadasana in Sanskrit (from "tada" meaning mountain), is a foundational yoga pose that represents steadiness and a grounded nature. It is often considered the starting point for many standing poses and is fundamental in understanding alignment and balance. The deeper meaning of Tadasana lies in its ability to help practitioners feel more rooted and connected to the earth, while at the same time reaching upwards with vitality like a tree. This pose teaches one to stand with poise and stability, embodying the strength and grace of a palm tree swaying gently in the wind.

Here are step-by-step instructions for performing Tadasana:

1. **Start Standing**:
   Begin by standing upright on your yoga mat with your feet together, heels slightly apart so that your big toes are touching. Distribute your weight evenly across both feet.

2. **Ground Your Feet**:
   Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet deep into the ground. Engage your leg muscles without locking your knees.

3. **Align Your Body**:
   Ensure that your knees are directly above your ankles, hips above knees, shoulders above hips, and ears above shoulders. Your pelvis should be neutral, with neither the front nor the back overly tilted.

4. **Activate Your Core**:
   Draw your belly button towards your spine to engage your core muscles gently.

5. **Relax Your Shoulders**:
   Let your arms hang naturally by the sides of your body with palms facing inward towards your thighs or slightly forward if it feels more natural.

6. **Lengthen Your Spine**:
   Imagine a string attached to the top of your head pulling you upwards, elongating your spine while keeping it neutral.

7. **Open Your Chest**:
   Broaden across the collarbones and lift through the sternum without pushing out through the ribs.

8. **Breathe**:
   Take several deep breaths here, feeling how each inhalation helps you grow taller and each exhalation grounds you further into the earth.

9. **Raise Your Arms (Optional)**:
   For a variation that enhances balance and focus, inhale deeply as you raise both arms overhead with palms facing each other or touching in prayer position (Anjali Mudra). Keep lifting through the sides of your waist as you reach up high like a palm tree's branches reaching towards sunlight.

10. **Hold The Pose**:
    Stay in this pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute, breathing deeply throughout.

11. **Release The Pose**:
    Exhale as you lower your arms (if raised) back down by your sides or bring them together in front of chest before releasing them down to return to step 5 position.

12. **Reflect**: 
    Take a moment to notice how you feel after performing Tadasana – physically grounded yet mentally uplifted, much like a sturdy yet flexible palm tree.

Remember that even though Tadasana may look simple, it's an active pose that involves awareness of every part of the body working together harmoniously. Practicing this pose can improve posture, balance, and focus both on and off the yoga mat.
