How to mock S3 locally in JavaScript. I want to create a fake S3 bucket for which all files will be stored locally and then they can be retrieved from there, similar to the package mock-aws-s3 https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-aws-s3 the description of the package is as follows:
"
This is a very simple interface that mocks the AWS SDK for Node.js. The implementation is incomplete but most basic features are supported.

Available:

- createBucket
- deleteBucket
- listObjects
- listObjectsV2
- deleteObjects
- deleteObject
- getObject
- headObject
- putObject
- copyObject
- getObjectTagging
- putObjectTagging
- upload
- getSignedUrl

It uses a directory to mock a bucket and its content.

If you'd like to see some more features or you have some suggestions, feel free to use the issues or submit a pull request.
"

The problem is, this package does not support the AWS SDK v3 - I need one that does.



If you need to mock Amazon S3 locally and require support for AWS SDK v3, you can use the `aws-sdk-mock` library or set up a local instance of an S3-compatible service like MinIO. Here's how you can do both:

### Using `aws-sdk-mock` with AWS SDK v3

The `aws-sdk-mock` library is designed to work with AWS SDK v2 by default, but it can be adapted to work with v3 as well. To mock S3 using `aws-sdk-mock` with the AWS SDK v3, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary packages:

```sh
npm install aws-sdk@^3 aws-sdk-mock jest --save-dev
```

2. Create your mock implementation in your test file:

```javascript
const mockS3 = require('aws-sdk-mock');
const { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');

// Mock the S3Client send method
mockS3.mock('S3Client', 'send', (command) => {
  if (command instanceof PutObjectCommand) {
    // Your mock logic for putObject
    return Promise.resolve({ /* Mocked response */ });
  }
});

// Your tests here

// After your tests, restore the mocks so they don't affect other tests
afterAll(() => {
  mockS3.restore('S3Client');
});
```

### Using MinIO for Local S3 Mocking

MinIO is an open-source object storage server that implements the same public API as Amazon S3. You can run it locally to simulate an S3 environment.

1. Download and run MinIO:

```sh
wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
chmod +x minio
./minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

This will start a local MinIO server with a web console available at http://localhost:9001.

2. Configure AWS SDK v3 to use the local MinIO instance:

```javascript
const { S3Client } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');

const s3 = new S3Client({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:9000', // Default MinIO endpoint
  forcePathStyle: true, // Required for MinIO compatibility
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: 'minioadmin', // Default access key for MinIO
    secretAccessKey: 'minioadmin' // Default secret key for MinIO
  },
});

// Now you can use `s3` as if it were talking to Amazon S3,
// but it will actually interact with your local MinIO server.
```

Using either of these methods will allow you to develop and test your application without needing actual AWS credentials or network connectivity to Amazon S3. Remember that while these tools are great for testing and development purposes, they may not fully replicate all features and behaviors of Amazon S3, so always ensure proper testing against the real service before deploying to production.
