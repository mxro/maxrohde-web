How to convert the following code using the new v3 AWS SDK:

```
  const downloadUrl = await new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {
      packageBucket.getSignedUrl(
        'getObject',
        {
          Bucket: bucketName,
          Key: `${projectId}/${packageId}/package.zip`,
          Expires: 3000, // duration in seconds that link will be valid for
        },
        (err, url) => {
          if (err) {
            reject(err);
            return;
          }
          resolve(url);
        }
      );
    });
```


To convert the code to use the new AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3), you'll need to use the `getSignedUrl` function from the `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` package, along with the S3 client from `@aws-sdk/client-s3`. Here's how you can rewrite your code:

First, install the necessary packages if you haven't already:

```sh
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

Then, update your code as follows:

```javascript
import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";

// Initialize S3 client
const s3Client = new S3Client({ region: "your-region" }); // Replace "your-region" with your actual region

// Function to get signed URL
async function getDownloadUrl(bucketName, projectId, packageId) {
  const command = new GetObjectCommand({
    Bucket: bucketName,
    Key: `${projectId}/${packageId}/package.zip`,
  });

  // Set expiration time for signed URL in seconds
  const expiresIn = 3000;

  try {
    const downloadUrl = await getSignedUrl(s3Client, command, { expiresIn });
    return downloadUrl;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error getting signed URL", err);
    throw err;
  }
}

// Usage example:
const bucketName = 'your-bucket-name';
const projectId = 'your-project-id';
const packageId = 'your-package-id';

getDownloadUrl(bucketName, projectId, packageId)
  .then((url) => {
    console.log('Download URL:', url);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Make sure to replace `'your-region'`, `'your-bucket-name'`, `'your-project-id'`, and `'your-package-id'` with your actual AWS region and specific values.

This updated code uses async/await syntax for better readability. The `getSignedUrl` function now takes an S3 command object and client instance as arguments and returns a promise that resolves to the signed URL.


The following is a list of methods supported by the S3 client of the AWS sdk v2. Convert them to the equlivaent class that is used for this operation. for instance: getObject should be GetObjectCommand in the new list.

- createBucket
- deleteBucket
- listObjects
- listObjectsV2
- deleteObjects
- deleteObject
- getObject
- headObject
- putObject
- copyObject
- getObjectTagging
- putObjectTagging
- upload


In AWS SDK for JavaScript v3, the S3 client has been modularized, and each operation is represented by a command class. The equivalent commands for the methods you've listed are as follows:

- createBucket -> CreateBucketCommand
- deleteBucket -> DeleteBucketCommand
- listObjects -> ListObjectsCommand
- listObjectsV2 -> ListObjectsV2Command
- deleteObjects -> DeleteObjectsCommand
- deleteObject -> DeleteObjectCommand
- getObject -> GetObjectCommand
- headObject -> HeadObjectCommand
- putObject -> PutObjectCommand
- copyObject -> CopyObjectCommand
- getObjectTagging -> GetObjectTaggingCommand
- putObjectTagging -> PutObjectTaggingCommand

For the `upload` method, in AWS SDK v3, you would typically use the `PutObjectCommand` for simple uploads. However, for multipart uploads (which is what the `upload` method might be used for in v2), you would use a combination of commands:

1. CreateMultipartUploadCommand to initiate the upload.
2. UploadPartCommand to upload each part.
3. CompleteMultipartUploadCommand to complete the upload after all parts have been uploaded.

There is also a utility provided by AWS SDK v3 called "@aws-sdk/lib-storage" which offers a simplified interface similar to the `upload` method from v2:

```javascript
const { S3Client } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");
const { Upload } = require("@aws-sdk/lib-storage");

// Example usage:
const client = new S3Client({ region: "us-west-2" });
const params = {
  Bucket: "example-bucket",
  Key: "example-object",
  Body: fileStream,
};
const uploader = new Upload({
  client,
  params,
});

uploader.done();
```

This utility handles the multipart upload process for you behind the scenes.


Remove from this list of x -> y values 'x->' so that only y remains:

- createBucket -> CreateBucketCommand
- deleteBucket -> DeleteBucketCommand
- listObjects -> ListObjectsCommand
- listObjectsV2 -> ListObjectsV2Command
- deleteObjects -> DeleteObjectsCommand
- deleteObject -> DeleteObjectCommand
- getObject -> GetObjectCommand
- headObject -> HeadObjectCommand
- putObject -> PutObjectCommand
- copyObject -> CopyObjectCommand
- getObjectTagging -> GetObjectTaggingCommand
- putObjectTagging -> PutObjectTaggingCommand

Add a `- ` to each of the following

CreateBucketCommand
DeleteBucketCommand
ListObjectsCommand
ListObjectsV2Command
DeleteObjectsCommand
DeleteObjectCommand
GetObjectCommand
HeadObjectCommand
PutObjectCommand
CopyObjectCommand
GetObjectTaggingCommand
PutObjectTaggingCommand

 - CreateBucketCommand
- DeleteBucketCommand
- ListObjectsCommand
- ListObjectsV2Command
- DeleteObjectsCommand
- DeleteObjectCommand
- GetObjectCommand
- HeadObjectCommand
- PutObjectCommand
- CopyObjectCommand
- GetObjectTaggingCommand
- PutObjectTaggingCommand
