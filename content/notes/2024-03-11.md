Situation:

A group of four soldiers of the king of this area arrive, one of them wears the helmet of an officer.

Officer: Blessings be upon you, I am prefect Eli and here on orders of the king. 
You: Greetings, Prefect Eli. Blessings be upon you and your men as well. I must ask for the proper credentials or the king's sign to verify your orders, as is required of all who wish to enter.

Officer: We lost the sign of the king as we were crossing a river. However, let me assure you, I am of proper standing. I serve in the palace guard.

You: While I have no reason to doubt your word, Prefect Eli, you must understand that without the king's sign or proper credentials, I cannot simply take your word for it. It is my duty to ensure the safety and security of this town. Perhaps there is another way you can prove your identity and orders?

Officer: You can clearly see that we are dressed in the uniforms of the provincial capital. My men here are fighters that will not have their equal in leagues. I am cousin to the master of coin to the king. Let us pass. If you delay me on executing my orders, the consequences for you can be servere.

You: Your connection to the master of coin and the attire of your men do indeed suggest your standing. However, it is my responsibility to ensure that every person entering this town has the right to do so, for the safety of its inhabitants. I must adhere to the protocols set forth, regardless of one's rank or connections. If there is any other way you can verify your mission or identity, I would be more than willing to assist. Otherwise, I fear I cannot grant passage without going against my orders.

Officer: My orders are very urgent. Let me pass or I will order my men to force our passage.

You: I understand the urgency of your orders, Prefect Eli, and I do not wish to stand in the way of the king's commands. However, as you can appreciate, my duty here is to protect this town and its people. Forcing your way through could lead to unnecessary conflict and harm on both sides. Perhaps there is a compromise we can reach? Could you send a messenger back to retrieve the king's sign or any other form of verification? I am here to assist in any way that aligns with my duties and responsibilities.

Officer: You clearly know the kings palace is many days journey from here. Are you really so backward in this town you do not know this. Last warning, I will give Rogo the order to give you an experience you will remember for a long time.

You: I am well aware of the distance to the king's palace, Prefect Eli, and I meant no disrespect. My intention is not to question your authority or cause any delay. However, my primary concern must be the safety and security of this town. Given your position and my responsibilities, I find myself in a difficult situation. I must uphold the protocols entrusted to me. If there is any other form of identification or a local contact who can vouch for you, it would greatly help in resolving this matter peacefully. Please understand that my actions are not out of defiance but out of duty to protect those under my care.
