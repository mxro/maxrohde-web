In the AWS JavaScript SDK v3 how to get the access key id and secret. This was previously possible by reading the Credentials.

 In the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3, you cannot directly access the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from the credentials object due to security best practices. The SDK is designed to abstract away the handling of credentials to minimize the risk of accidental exposure.

However, if you need to provide credentials programmatically, you can do so by setting them when initializing a client or by using a credentials provider. Here's an example of how you might set up a client with hardcoded credentials (which is not recommended for production due to security concerns):

```javascript
import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { fromIni } from "@aws-sdk/credential-provider-ini";

// Initialize S3 client with hardcoded credentials (not recommended)
const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: "us-west-2",
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: "your_access_key_id", // Replace with your access key id
    secretAccessKey: "your_secret_access_key" // Replace with your secret access key
  }
});

// Use s3Client for operations...
```

If you have stored your credentials in a shared INI file (typically located at `~/.aws/credentials`), you can use a credential provider like this:

```javascript
import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { fromIni } from "@aws-sdk/credential-provider-ini";

// Initialize S3 client with credentials from INI file
const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: "us-west-2",
  credentials: fromIni({ profile: 'your_profile_name' }) // Replace 'your_profile_name' with your AWS profile name
});

// Use s3Client for operations...
```

For security reasons, it's better to use environment variables or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles when deploying applications. This way, you don't need to hardcode sensitive information in your code.

If you're running your application on an AWS service that supports IAM roles (like EC2, Lambda, ECS), it's best to attach an IAM role with the necessary permissions directly to the service. The SDK will automatically retrieve and rotate these temporary security credentials for you.

Remember never to expose your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key unnecessarily and avoid checking them into source control. Always follow AWS best practices for managing and using AWS credentials securely.
