How to provide endpoint in AWS SDK v3 JavaScrtip

 In AWS SDK for JavaScript version 3 (v3), you can provide a custom endpoint to an AWS service client by setting the `endpoint` parameter in the client's configuration object. This can be useful if you want to direct API calls to a local endpoint for testing, or to an alternate service endpoint.

Here is an example of how you might set a custom endpoint when creating a new client for Amazon S3:

```javascript
const { S3Client } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");

// Set the custom endpoint
const customEndpoint = "https://my-custom-endpoint.com";

// Create an S3 client with the custom endpoint
const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: "us-west-2", // specify your region
  endpoint: customEndpoint,
  // You can also include other configuration options here, such as credentials
});

// Now you can use s3Client to make requests to your custom endpoint
```

When providing a custom endpoint, ensure that it is formatted as a complete URL including the protocol (http or https).

If you need to configure additional options like SSL verification or path style access, you can pass those configurations along with the `endpoint` parameter:

```javascript
const { S3Client } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");

const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: "us-west-2",
  endpoint: {
    hostname: "my-custom-endpoint.com",
    protocol: "https",
    pathStyleEndpoint: true, // Use path-style access (http://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/key)
    disableSsl: false, // If true, SSL validation is disabled (not recommended for production)
  },
});
```

Please note that when using a custom endpoint with an AWS service client, certain features and behaviors of the AWS SDK may not work as expected if the provided endpoint does not fully support them.

Always refer to the latest AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 documentation for any updates or changes regarding how to configure clients and endpoints.

How to read the proprties in DynamoDBClientResolvedConfig in AWS JavaScript SDK?

 In the AWS JavaScript SDK (v3), the `DynamoDBClientResolvedConfig` is a type that represents the resolved configuration for a `DynamoDBClient`. This configuration is typically built when you instantiate a `DynamoDBClient` and includes both the default settings and any overrides you provide.

To read properties from the `DynamoDBClientResolvedConfig`, you would typically access them directly on an instance of `DynamoDBClient`. Here's an example of how to create a DynamoDB client, and then read some properties from its resolved configuration:

```javascript
const { DynamoDBClient } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb");

// Instantiate a DynamoDB client with optional configuration
const client = new DynamoDBClient({
  region: "us-west-2",
  // other configuration options...
});

// Accessing resolved configuration properties
async function printResolvedConfig() {
  // The resolved config can be accessed via the "config" property of the client
  const resolvedConfig = await client.config();

  console.log("Region:", resolvedConfig.region);
  console.log("Endpoint:", resolvedConfig.endpoint);
  // Access other properties as needed...
}

printResolvedConfig().catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error accessing DynamoDB client config:", error);
});
```

Please note that in this example, we're using an asynchronous function to print the resolved config. This is because some of the SDK's operations might be asynchronous, such as credential resolution or getting endpoints. If you're sure that all configurations are static (e.g., when you've provided all necessary information synchronously), you could access them directly without awaiting.

The actual properties available on the `DynamoDBClientResolvedConfig` will depend on what version of the SDK you're using and what options are available at that time. Always refer to the specific version of your SDK documentation for details on which properties are available in your `DynamoDBClientResolvedConfig`.
