Have reincarnation as one of the concepts that can bring us solace (along with the existing of a God or benevolent power).

However note that it is better to understand it in a different way than presented by hindusim and buddhism. It is a more fluid concept.

Think about what you find most precious within yourself. You can nurture this and also change things about yourself.

Based on what you are at any point, there are others who are like you, now, in the past and in the future. That is how your spirit and soul never dies but oscillates around the population of humans there are.
