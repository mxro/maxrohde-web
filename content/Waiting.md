**Introduction:**

Waiting is becoming an increasingly dreaded aspect of our lives. We live in an era that seeks to minimise waiting wherever possible, driven by our growing intolerance for delays and need for instant gratification. However, is waiting really something that is inherently undesirable and should be avoided? Inspired by Herman Hesse's timeless novel, Siddhartha, this article delves into the art of waiting and how it can be harnessed as a powerful tool for personal growth and enlightenment.

Waiting encompasses various dimensions, ranging from the trivial to the profound. In earlier times, humans had to endure lengthy periods of waiting, whether for news, transportation, or the fulfillment of desires. While our modern world has made significant strides in reducing wait times, our growing impatience has shifted the focus from embracing the act of waiting to the art of avoiding it. I believe this is fundamentally misguided and will argue for the value in waiting itself in the following.

**Siddhartha's Insight: Waiting as a Skill**

In Hermann Hesse's novel Siddhartha, the eponymous protagonist embarks on a spiritual journey in search of truth and self-realisation. During his pursuit, Siddhartha encounters various teachers and learns profound lessons. When the merchant Kamaswami asks the young monk Siddhartha what skills he possesses, Siddhartha responds, "I can think, I can wait, I can fast."

Kamaswami questions the usefulness of these skills, and Siddhartha explains the benefits of fasting:

>When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the smartest thing he could do. When, for example, Siddhartha hadn’t learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before this day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force him to do so. But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow hunger to besiege him and can laugh about it. This, sir, is what fasting is good for.

Siddhartha also explains how thinking, waiting and fasting enable him to reach his goals to the courtesan Kamala:

> When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn’t let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal.

> “When the opponent expands, I contract. When he contracts, I expand. And, when there is an opportunity, I do not hit — it hits all by itself.”

— wrote Bruce Lee

**Patience as a Virtue**

While there is scant discussion on waiting as a skill or virtue, there is plenty of discussion on the subject of patience. In the following, I will briefly review patience as a virtue from the perspective of Artistotle, the Stoics and David Hume.

Aristotle viewed patience as a virtue associated with self-control and moderation. According to Aristotle, patience involves enduring hardship or delay without excessive complaint or frustration. He believed that patience stems from a balanced disposition, where an individual maintains a calm and composed attitude in the face of adversity.

For Aristotle, patience was closely linked to his broader concept of temperance, which encompassed moderation in all aspects of life. He argued that practicing patience helps individuals achieve a harmonious balance between excessive emotional reactions and unyielding impatience. By exercising self-control and enduring difficulties with composure, one could cultivate patience as a virtue and attain a state of moral excellence.

Stoic philosophers regarded patience as a vital virtue in leading a tranquil and virtuous life. Patience, or "hupomonē" in Greek, was highly valued by Stoics such as Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. They believed that patience involved enduring life's challenges and setbacks with inner strength and resilience, and it played a fundamental role in achieving wisdom, self-mastery, and tranquility of mind.

For Stoics, patience meant accepting and embracing the inevitable hardships and adversities of life without complaint or resistance. They recognized that many things in life were beyond their control, and patience allowed them to navigate these circumstances with equanimity. Stoics emphasized that patience should not be mistaken for passivity or indifference but rather as a deliberate and conscious choice to respond to life's trials with rationality and composure. 

David Hume, an influential figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, recognized the challenges inherent in practicing patience, as humans are naturally inclined towards immediate gratification and struggle to tolerate delays or frustrations.

Hume acknowledged that patience involves restraining impulsive desires and suppressing feelings of anger or annoyance when confronted with obstacles. However, he also emphasized the importance of a realistic understanding of human nature. Hume argued that patience is not an innate quality but a cultivated habit that emerges through experience and reflection. He believed that patience arises from recognizing the limits of human control over external circumstances and accepting the inevitability of certain outcomes beyond one's immediate influence.

Patience, a virtue closely intertwined with waiting, empowers individuals to navigate the uncertainties of life with grace and equanimity. It allows us to embrace the present moment, relinquishing our obsession with immediate gratification. Cultivating patience requires a shift in perspective, recognizing that waiting offers an opportunity for self-reflection, introspection, and personal growth. By reframing waiting as a valuable process rather than an inconvenient pause, we can transform our experience of time itself.

**The Power of Mindful Waiting**

> “Why is patience so important?”
> “Because it makes us pay attention.”

Paulo Coelho

Mindfulness, the art of being fully present in the moment, can greatly enhance our experience of waiting. Instead of allowing restlessness and frustration to consume us, we can turn waiting into a meditative practice. Engaging our senses, observing our breath, or immersing ourselves in the surrounding environment can anchor us to the present, transcending the anticipation of the future. Mindful waiting empowers us to find beauty, stillness, and wisdom even in the midst of apparent stagnation.

**Embracing Impermanence and Detachment**

Waiting often revolves around the desire for something yet to come—a desired outcome, a change, or a resolution. However, the essence of waiting lies in embracing impermanence and relinquishing attachment. By recognizing the transient nature of all things, we can release our grip on expectations and surrender to the flow of life. In this surrender, we discover liberation from the restlessness that arises from clinging to specific outcomes. Waiting becomes a space of surrender and acceptance rather than an endurance test.

**The Wisdom of Waiting**
Waiting can be a profound teacher, imparting invaluable lessons along our journey. It reveals the importance of resilience, teaching us to endure challenges with patience and fortitude. It fosters humility, reminding us of our place in the grand tapestry of existence. Waiting also cultivates empathy, as we recognize that others around us are

 also enduring their own periods of waiting. Through this shared experience, we connect with our fellow human beings on a deeper level, fostering compassion and understanding.

**Conclusion:**
In a world that constantly urges us to rush, achieve, and minimize waiting, the art of waiting stands as a counterbalance—an invitation to slow down, reflect, and embrace the beauty of the present moment. From the mundane to the profound, waiting holds the potential for personal transformation and enlightenment. By cultivating patience, practicing mindfulness, embracing impermanence, and extracting wisdom from the experience of waiting, we can navigate life's journey with grace and equanimity. As Siddhartha exemplifies, the ability to wait is not a passive act but an essential skill that invites profound self-discovery and spiritual growth. May we embrace waiting as an opportunity for introspection, resilience, and connection, unlocking the profound lessons it has to offer.
