There is a certain kind of book that in my mind I classify as a capital N Novel; a story that has brooding characters and paints the world in dark pastel, and has a bit of edginess and depravation to it. Philip Roth's works come to mind here (which I tried to read, but could not - there was just too much novel in the ones I sampled). Most recently I remember reading The Gloaming which I would also see as a Novel.

I see The Glass Kingdom in the same light. As a special twist, The Glass Kingdom is set in the rich fabric of Bangkok, which I think is a fascinating backdrop. Unfortunately it is for the most part just seen from the perspective of a foreigner (a bit like the TV show The Serpent I watched recently which is also set in Bangkok but almost exclusively told from the perspective of foreigners).

There are some interesting bits and pieces of knowledge about Thailand and Bangkok that can be gleamed from the book; but overall I found the story and characters not very engaging. Concerningly I got the impression that a lot of the Thai characters where portrayed particularly devious (lies, deception and murder are just some of the behaviours engaged in). Not that - this being a Novel - there are a lot of characters shown in a positive light. However I think people overall are good, not lying, deceiving murderers, and I think this novel and others may benefit from bringing in at least a few characters that balance things out.
