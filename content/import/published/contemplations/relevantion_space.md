I have come across a list of noteable space opera books, and as my previous reviews have shown, I am slowly working my way through these. 

As in the Void Triology, in Revelation Space extreme cosmological phenomena feature as central points in the story, as well as galaxy and eon spanning civilisations. 

I especially liked here the subplot of unearthing the secrets of an acient alien civilisation. In contrast to Consider Phlebas the AIs in Revelation Space are not benevolent.

I found Relevantion Space like Consider Phlebas a bit more pulpy than the Void Triology though, with more of a focus on action and small elements of horror.
