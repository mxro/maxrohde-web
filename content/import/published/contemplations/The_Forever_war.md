Continuing through my quests of reading through works of Classic Science fiction, I arrived at The Forever War by Joe Haldeman.

The first edition of the Forever War was published in 1970 - but there is really very little here that would show its age. Humanity is engaged in a war with an alien species that spans many solar systems and centuries. It follows the life of a soldier, who lives a normal human lifespan - but due to being shuttled around the Milky Way at relativistic speeds. So a few years of his life result in centuries having passed on Earth.

To me, the forever war is very much a critique on warfare. There are few heroic acts, but in their stead, plenty of death and suffering. Moreover, it also shows the costs that the war has on those left behind on Earth, with all resources being siphoned off for the war effort.

Overall, I found the Forever War very gripping and a very pleasant read.
