Some Star Wars media can feel a bit repetitive, with the same tropes repeated over and over. Chaos Rising was very refreshing in that it builds a world removed from the usual characters and locations of the Star Wars universe, there are no Jedis to be found.

Overall entertaining but not revolutionary.
