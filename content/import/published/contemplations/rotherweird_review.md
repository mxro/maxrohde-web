Rotherweird by Andrew Caldecott is an ambitious and extensive work of fiction. It is set in an intriguing world, which is a mix between steampunk and mediaeval fantasy. What I really liked about it was its setting and world building as well as some of the characters which were quite interesting.

However, overall Rotherweird didn't manage to grab me fully and I felt like it was dragging on for quite a bit. Which surprised me because the world building and the characters are quite well put together. Maybe the weakest part is the story, which feels like it follows familiar fantasy tropes.

When reading Rotherweird, I unwisely decided to try out a few memory techniques to help me remember all the names of characters. Little did I know when I started reading the book that there is an extensive cast of characters. In addition, characters are also given quite unusual names, which didn't make remembering them any easier.

In any case, with some struggles, I managed to remember the names of the characters, even if that slowed down my reading quite significantly, since I often had to go back and and and look for names I forget. However, when writing this review I can recall the names of more than 80% of all characters; which is a great step up from where I am usually at when writing a review: usually I struggle to even remember the names of the key protagonists.

Below a list of some of the characters that feature in Rotherweird:

The British Queen from the sixteenth century, Mary Tudor, only featured very briefly in the beginning to set the group of special, gifted children that would form the seed of Rotherweird on their way.

Lady Imogen Slickstone is the wife of Lord Veronal Slickstone. Not his real wife, mind you, but an actress he hires to play the role of his wife when he settles down in Rotherweird.

Angela Trimble is is an administrator for the local school of Rotherweird. Mrs Danderei Banter is somewhat wealthy woman that owns an antique shop of which the day to day operation she leaves to her niece Orelia Roc.

Orelia Rock runs the shop of Mrs Banter, which sells old items and trinkets.

Vixen Valourhand is a staff member of a local research institution. I believe she specialises in physics and is often quite independent spirit. Among other things, she is the first one to confront Veronal Slickstone directly. She also features briefly as a potential love interest for Jonah Oblong when she disguises herself as an liberian with the name Cecily Sheridan.

Aggs is working as the housekeeper for some of the university staff, namely Jonah Oblong and before him Robert Flask.

Morval Seer is one of the gifted children that seeded the town of Rotherweird in the early 16th century. In contrast to most of the other gifted children that were brought to Rotherweird she came from the local area. Same as her brother, Hieronymus Seer. Morval is merged with a spider and becomes a hideous creature in the alternative reality linked to Rotherweird, Lost Acre.

Bomber Fanguin is the wife of the local biology teacher Godfery Fanguin.

Robert Oxenbridge is a military officer in the early 16th century who was tasked with imprisoning all the gifted children by the order of Mary Tudor; an order which he does not follow and instead hides away the children in the town of Rotherweird.

Henry Grassal is a friend of Robert Oxenbridge, who Oxenbridge entrusts with looking after the gifted children and founding Rotherweird.

Lord Veronal Slickstone is the main antagonist in the story. He was one of the original gifted children who, in the early 16th century, gained longevity. He lost all his memories, though, and spend a few centuries building up a criminal empire. When he was made aware of the existence of the town of Rotherweird, he decided to take up residence in this town. 

Jonah Oblong is to some degree the main protagonist of the story - as much as this can be said within the extensive ensemble cast. He is an outsider from wider England who is invited to work as a history teacher in Rotherweird, a position complicated by the fact that it is forbidding to study any events before the 18th century; a rule put in place by Robert Oxenbridge in the 16th century to help guard the dark secrets of Rotherweird.

Bill Ferdy is the owner of the local pub and a brewer.

Robert Flask was the history teacher proceeding Jonah Oblong at Rotherweird school. It later turns out that he is the shape shifter Calx Bole who was present at the time gifted children were first coming to Rotherweird. At that time, he was assistant of Greyon Wynter.

Godfery Fanguin is a biology teacher at the local school and a confidant of Robert Flask. He passes on some information to Jonah Oblong that helps to resolve some of his mysteries surrounding Rotherweird.

Hieronymous Seer was one of the original gifted children being present at the establishment of Rotherweird. He appears in the present day story as Ferensen, since he gained longevity just like a Veronal Slickstone.

Hengest Strimmer is an academic at a local research institution, a colleague of Vixen Valourhand, and later an ally of Sir Veronal Slickstone.

Vessey Bonitho is also a member of academic faculty of research institution.

Gregorious Jones is a physical education teacher who has a penchant for helping women in distress.

Marmion Finch is the record keeper of the town of Rotherweird and herald. He is the only one permitted to have access to historical documents, but only under certain circumstances dictated by Robert Oxenbridge in the 16th century.

Sydney Snorkel is the mayor of Rotherweird, a position long held by his family and he is always interested in maintaining his power.

Rhombus Smith is the headmaster of the local school.

Greyon Wynter is a treasure hunter, that robbed graves in the 16th century, when he by chance, came across the school made of of the gifted children of Rotherweird. He schemes to gain control of the school and children them. He exploits some of the dark magic available in the alternative reality of Lost Acre. Eventually, he is brought down by intervention of Robert Oxenbridge and sentenced to death.

Calx Bole is his assistant surfacing in the present day story as Robert Flask.

Ferensen is an enigmatic figure that emerges in the town of Rotherweird from time to time; living in a building in the farm of the Ferdy's.

Boris and Bert Polk are inventors. They create various contraptions such as a charabanc that is powered by steam engine, a flying device that I used to enter Lost Acre and a vehicle that is used to squelch a fire.

Ferox, half man, half weasel, entered the alternate reality of Lost Acre during the times of the Roman occupation of Great Britain. Also having gained longevity, he features both in a story set in the 16th century as well as the present day story (though in present day he is actually the shapeshifter Calx Bole).

Mors Valet is as the local caretaker in the town of Rotherweird.

As can be seen, Rotherweird has a large cast of diverse characters. Notwithstanding that, I think the story is easy to follow, if at times the weirdness that is not only found in the title of the book but also in its prose, can make certain happenings difficult to follow.
