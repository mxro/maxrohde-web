Back in the 18th and 19th century, a popular genre of nonfiction were the accounts of explorers from around the world. One superstar of this particular kind of literature for instance was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4190985961">Alexander von Humboldt</a>. To me, The Biggest Biggest Bluff is also an account of a writer going on an adventure, taking us, the readers, along with it, and sharing with us the experiences and learnings that were obtained during the journey. The journey here though is not to the Amazonas but to the world of professional poker players.

The underlying premise of The Biggest Bluff is that by studying poker, we can learn something about life and some of the deep rules that determine success and failure. It is difficult to refute that many of the things we do are governed by chance, and thus that our ability to mange risk and our desire to take or avoid risks have a big impact on how things are going in our lives. Poker, as it so happens, is precisely about understanding, managing and becoming familiar with chance and risk.

Some interesting learnings here are:

- We are ill equipped to understand the workings of chance. Our brains are hard-wired to see patterns were they are none. This leads us to believe in 'hot streaks' of good luck, that, usually, end in catastrophe since we start to underestimate risk.
- To play poker well is way more complicated than I imagined. One needs to have a very good understanding of probabilities emerging from the combination of cards held on hand and open cards visible to everyone (The Biggest Bluff is exclusively about the most popular form of poker today, Texas Hold'em). To me, the whole journey described here didn't seem like fun at all, but more like very hard work.

Overall, I think this was an interesting account of a unique journey. I especially liked how concrete experiences were enriched with academic knowledge (even though its stemming from the field of psychology, which is generally a bit suspect to me, due to a poor track record of replication).
