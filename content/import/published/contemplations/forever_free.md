I really liked the first book in this series, The Forever War. It easily transported me to different world(s) and had a kind of intense, fast paced story telling and some thought provoking situations and environments.

Forever Free was just kind of long winded and ended on a somewhat strange note. I do admire what the book tried to accomplish here, to meditate on the deep meaning of the universe, but somehow the pieces just didn't fit together. It feels a bit like that one bad episode in a favourite SciFi series.
