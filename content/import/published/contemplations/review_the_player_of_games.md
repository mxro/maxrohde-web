I did not enjoy the first entry in Iain Bank's Culture series, Consider Phlebas. I thought it was a bit too rough-hewn even though it contained a lot of promising ideas. I am glad that I gave the next entry in the series, The Player of Games, a chance. It contains all the same exciting ideas without the unnecessary gruesomeness and spotty plot.

The central theme of the Culture series is the eponymous Culture civilisation. A galaxy spanning entity controlled by highly sophisticated machine intelligences called 'minds'. In contrast to other works of fiction where computers are put in charge, the Culture series is not dystopian but utopian. Rather than exterminating advanced biological beings, the Culture minds and autonomous drones work together with humans to create a post-scarcity civilisation.

There is no shortage of any basic goods and services. There is even no shortage of the most basic of resource, living space. Most of culture inhabitants live on artificial worlds in which more living space is created than could be used. Humans and intelligent machines alike can express themselves in elaborate ways. For instance, one character in The Player of Games, Yay, has taken on as her/his passion to craft new continents for orbital space stations.

The Player of Games is centred on the interesting premise of the Culture civilisation encountering an imperialist and expansionist empire, called the empire of Azad. The minds of the Culture, while not interested in conquest, are interested in providing safety for the citizens of the Culture, as well as expanding the benefits of their way of life to the less fortunate. 

To deal with other civilisations the Culture maintains a kind of espionage operation called Special Circumstances. The operatives of this organisation are sent to influence societies in ways the minds of the Culture deem beneficial.

The main character of Player of Games is Gurgeh, one of the best game players of the Culture. Rather than specialising in one particular game, Gurgeh and others like him aim for excellence in playing games in general.

The distribution of power in the empire of Azad is built around a highly sophisticated game called Azad. Gurgeh is dispatched to participate in a six-yearly tournament. The winner of the tournament will be crowned the new emperor of Azad.

I think this is a very interesting premise; a clash of two civilisations, a succession of competitive games being able to drive the narrative (an often employed device, for instance in Ender's Game). In addition there are a few interesting twists in the plot, even if they do not come all that unsurprisingly. 

Consider Phlebas and The Player of Games are only loosely connected by their shared setting in the world of the Culture. This gives me hope for the continuation of the series. I think building a grand space opera or an epic fantasy series is more about establishing an interesting world, rather than trying to scramble together a grand narrative. I am looking forward to reading the next book of the Culture series, Use of Weapons; which I am sure will introduce a another novel approach of looking at this world.
