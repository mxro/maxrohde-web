Although Consider Phlebas was published in 1987 there is very little about it that would show its age, and this notwithstanding one of its major themes being computer-based AIs. I think that is quite astonishing given how much computing and technology has evolved in the last 25 years.

What I found most interesting is that the main protagonist, Bora Horza Gobuchul, is more like an antagonist. Instead of aligning with the humans that have created a near paradisical society, he is an ally of an aggressive, fundamentalist and expansionist alien empire. His methods are often questionable. Yet he also has some moments of goodness and kindness.

Bora is on a mission to rescue an AI that has been lost in battle. On his way there he encounters a ship and crew that somehow reminds me of the SciFi television series Firefly.

Overall I think the narration lacks a bit of clarity and depth, but it is still a pleasant enough read.
