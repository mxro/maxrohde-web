How to Remember Anything sticks to the objectives set out by the author; to provide a to-the-point and practical reference to common memory techniques. I am sure there are plenty of other books around that have the same or similar content - but How to Remember Anything still offers a nice and quick overview of some common techniques.

Here some notable ones:

- The _cube system_ involves assigning a number to each corner (odd) and walls (even) of a room one is familiar with, and then placing memory images into these locations. For instance to remember a shopping list with wine and avocados, one may imagine in location 1 of the room (a corner since 1 is odd) a person-sized shimming wine bottle, while seeing on the wall next to it (location 2) a waterfall of avocados.
- _Audionyms_ can be used for abstract concepts. To turn an abstract concept into a memory image, try to find a similar sounding word and then use that as a stand-in of the concept. For instance, to remember liberty, imagine a library, etc.
- _Association_ relies on linking something which we already know with something we want to remember. For instance, when seeing a person we would like to remember their name. Key here is to create mental images for both what we already know and what we want to remember. Once these images are created, we can link these images. Vaughn suggests that the images should be linked in a way that is as illogical and impossible. For instance, if my images are an airplane and a rose, I could image an airport transporting roses (possible) or an airplane creating a contrail of roses (impossible).
- The _Major System_ for remembering numbers (interestingly not referenced by Vaughn by that name but instead as the _Number Code_). In this common memory technique numbers are linked to consonants. Lists of numbers are converted into words by chaining multiple consonants together with vowels and half-vowels. These words should ideally be powerful memory images. For instance the number 1 is associated with the consonant 't' and the number 0 is associated with the consonant 's'. We could just create the word/image 'toes' to remember the number 10. It is actually quite difficult to come up with words using these rules, thus most practitioners of this memory technique will memorise the words for at least the numbers between 00 and 99.

There are further techniques described in the book but I think the above seemed the most useful to me in terms of being relatively straightforward. Note similar techniques are described in many other books on memory, such as [The Art of Memory by Frances Yates](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4371670825) and [Moonwalking with Einstein by Josh Foer](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4507290109).
