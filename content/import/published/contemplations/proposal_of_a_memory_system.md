# Memory System Part 1: Ancient Techniques and Modern Applications

I've recently been thinking about how to become better at dictation or to use speech to compose text. One important area of study that I came across in relation to this is rhetoric. Improving memory in turn is an important part of the discipline of rhetoric. In this article, I will briefly describe some ancient techniques to improve memory as well as propose what I think possible modern day uses for an improved memory could be (spoiler, it is not for remembering phone numbers). In future articles I will describe a number of techniques, adapted from the classical ones, I find helpful for the identified modern day usages. 

## The Art of Memory in Ancient Rhetoric

There seem to be a few core components of enhancing our natural memory that has been used by the ancient orators. For instance, there's often an emphasis on and viewing our memories with more emotional heft and context. This is based on the hypothesis that our brains are wired to remember emotional, natural things better than artificial conceptual and theoretical ones. For example, to remember the concept of love, one may instead try to remember the imagine of the Greek god Eros with his signature quiver and bow.

Another very popular method has been to place memories within physical spaces. So, for instance, you may imagine objects to be placed in different rooms of your house. If one has to remember abstract ideas, these can be transformed into memorable images using the method just described. For retrieving these objects from your memory, you just simply imagine yourself walking through your house and inspecting the placed objects one by one. So for instance, we could imagine Eros to fly around in the entrance hall and then Athena (representing wisdom) guarding the door to our bedroom to remember love, temptation and prudence.

There are myriad books describing methods such as these and related ones. A very good introduction is Moonwalking with Einstein by ...  I've also recently read The Art of Memory by Frances Yates, which goes into much detail how these simple rules have evolved (or devolved, depending on ones perspective) throughout the centuries.

Personally, I do not doubt that these methods can be effective, but I have my doubts about them. Indeed, even ancient scholars have questioned efficacy of these methods, asking if it may not just be easier to learn by repetition.

The main drawback of these methods in my mind is that they add a bit of Baroque complexity to what we want to remember. Maybe sometimes it's easier to just remember love rather than trying to come up with a specific image representing this concept, and then instilling this image with emotional significance. If we need to spend so much thinking, so much of our creativity on creating these images I wonder if we may not use our faculties more fruitfully for something else.

## Modern Benefits of Improved Memory

I've mentioned that training memory was understood to be an important part of rhetoric. Ancient orators, such as Cicero, would use techniques such as those described above to remember their arguments. Generally before writing instruments, books and digital tools became widely available, having a good memory must have been of far greater importance than it is today.  

If we want to remember things nowadays, we can write them down, we can take a picture with our phone, or we can send ourselves a note. Generally, we have plenty of tools available that help in remembering things, so I don't think it's really worth it to go through all that effort to try to have a better memory for things that I can just look up on my phone in one second.

However, notwithstanding that, I think trying to be better at keeping things in our memory has two potential very powerful applications.

First of all, I think that having a better memory may be quite beneficial for us in terms of aiding our thinking. If we are able to remember more things, if we keep more things in our memory, then I believe we can think about these things in new ways. It is often observed that when writing something down, we are able to come up with new ideas that we have not thought about before. Likewise, speaking our thoughts out loud can lead to new insights. But likewise can daydreaming; however in contrast to writing down things or sharing our ideas in conversations, whatever insights we unearth while daydreaming will easily be lost if our memory is poor. Not that we get much opportunity to daydream in today's digitally saturated world; because when I am waiting for the train and I take out my phone and start browsing the news, then my creativity will not be engaged. But if I do manage to stay undistracted, then having a systematic, structured way to remember my thinking can be very valuable.

 The second modern application for improving ones memory is more of an indirect one. I believe that if we think about something and work on making it easier to remember for ourselves, that can be valuable by making it more memorable for others. Let us consider for example the movie Star Wars. It is very easy to remember the characters and storylines in the classic Star Wars movies, and I think that is because they are made in a way that they are very easy for us to remember. Darth Vader for instance is this tall figure with a very unusual mask, voice and powerful musical themes to accompany his appearances in the movie. Even years after watching Star Wars, you are sure to remember Darth Vader. 
 
 I think it can actually be an important aspect of stories of how easily they can be remembered. Since if they are easy to remember, they are easier to follow and provide more lasting value. And training ourselves in making things easier to remember for us can make us better at creating more memorable worlds, characters and stories.

This article provided a brief introduction to classical memory techniques as well as what I see could be modern day applications for a memory improved using these techniques of the ancients. In a number of follow up articles, I will describe my own adaptations of techniques I found to be very useful for myself and which maybe of use to anyone else interested in the abovementioned applications.

# Memory System Part 2: 3x3 Grid

I have outlined in part 1 of this series possible applications for an improved memory. The two applications I suggested were: (1) to be able to aid our imagination and creativity and (2) create more memorable stories. I think the second application is really only relevant for those who want to become better creators of fictional stories, whereas the first application really should be of relevance to everyone. In this article, I will introduce a simple technique I believe can be of use for the first application of improved memory; to help us keep our ideas and thoughts organized while using no other tool but our imagination.

 I'm very aware that this is not the first time it has been attempted to define a mnemonic system of some form. There are literally thousands of books, articles, discussions that aim to provide memory systems. However, I often found these these to be quite repetitive and focus on the same set of rules. They are also often focussed on helping us remember specific classes of things such as numbers, names or faces.

Hence, I believe that there is some value in proposing a technique that is specific to helping us unleash our creative thinking. However, given that there are so many resources on memory systems available, I am aware I may very well be just reinventing something that someone else has already come up with in one from or another.

With that disclaimer out of the way, let me briefly explain what I thought of as a technique for the first application of an improved memory, a technique specifically geared towards enabling abstract thinking and imagining things in a very fluid and dynamic way.

The centrepiece of the technique is a simple 3-by-3 grid that consists of nine cells. You place concepts and ideas into these cells, remembering specifically into which cell which concept or idea was placed. For instance, if I was contemplating the Nobel Eightfold Path from Buddhists' tradition, I may arrange each of the steps of the path as follows:

[Right View, Right Thinking, Right Speech]
[Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Diligence]
[Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration]

Each of the concepts placed upon the grid can be further broken down by another 3-by-3 grid. So for instance, the concept of Right Mindfulness maybe represented by another grid that contains the Four Establishments of Mindfulness as follows:

[Body, Feelings, Mind, Objects of Mind]

Note these grids should ideally not be written down, but just be composed in your mind. And while it will be good to go through these grids in your mind multiple times to establish them in your memory, they should fundamentally be seen as dynamic, so that our shifting understandings and thoughts can be represented. So if I also want to consider the concept of attention as well as the Seven Miracles of Mindfulness, I may change the grid that breaks down Right Mindfulness into the following:

[Four Establishments of Mindfulness, Attention, Miracles of Mindfulness]

So to summarise the key rules for 3x3 memory grids are:

- Concepts are placed in specific locations on a 3x3 grid
- Concepts can be broken down by further 3x3 grids
- One should revisit a grid multiple times to anchor it in memory
- It is allowed and encouraged to move concepts on a grid and between grids
- You can create as many grids as you like, they can be connected (one grid the breakdown of a concept of another grid) or not

Further to these fundamental rules, there are a few suggestions that can be useful in working with these grids:

- It is often advisable to place concepts on the grid in the same order as we would be writing on a page (at least in Western languages): from left to right and top to bottom. This though is not a strict rule and sometimes it maybe better to place concepts in a semantic way (e.g. to put the most central idea in the middle, or arrange related ideas into separate rows or columns).
- It can be helpful to visualise the grid in a specific location. Here I would suggest to visualise it upright directly in front of yourself at arms length, and large enough that one would have to reach a bit to reach the corners of the grid.
- It can be beneficial to use mnemonic techniques such as using images instead of concepts and making what we place on the grid remarkable in some way. This can be of particular use for an anchor concept on the grid, for instance the one at the top left or centre position. Since remembering one of the concepts aids in remembering the rest of them. I understand such images as adornments to the original concepts to be remembered in a similar way as images are added to illuminated manuscripts.
- It maybe useful to associate names and/or images to each cell of the grid - these would be the same in every grid and help remember where something is placed on the grid. This is a kind of adornment, just one that is applied to every grid. For instance, one may use the following terms:

[Anchor,North,Banner]
[West,Centre,East]
[Low,South,Ultimate]

Or the following images:

[Sea,Ice Cap,Battleground]
[Prairie,Castle,Rice Fields]
[Cave,Desert,Mountain]

Note though that adornment of any kind should be used with caution, since imaging them takes time and distracts from the core concepts we want to remember. We should use them primarily as temporary memory aids until we become more familiar with a topic or for things that we think we are likely to forget.

This grid is a simple mechanisms that we can use to help us with unleashing our creativity and imagination and give some kind of structure and shape to our thoughts. That makes it easy for us to retrieve our thoughts and ideas and expand on them as we go along. Starting with one 3-by-3 grid and placing a few things and there, breaking it down and creating new grids will over time create quite sophisticated systems that can be continually improved.

After some time we may want to extract what we have created in the grids and put it into a knowledge management tool such as Notion or just write it down on a piece of paper. But crucially we have the freedom to not have to do so right away. Once we have built up the confidence that our thoughts do not get lost if we do not record them right away in some capacity, we are empowered to think in new ways and not have our thought processes interrupted by the need to look for a piece of paper or open up our phone.

However, even with lots of practice, there will always be chance that we may forget something placed on the grids. But I think that may not be as significant as we fear, since if we have found something that is profound and that we know is important, then we are very unlikely to forget it. So what we actually forget maybe all our not so good ideas, and thus our memory becomes a natural filter that only leaves our very best ideas.

As I have mentioned, I think this memory grid is key for enabling the first application for improved memory; enhancing our imagination and creativity. This system is for the most part built on the classical ideas of improved memory: placing concepts into a particular place and also putting them into a particular order. This grid is just a simplified, in that in places more trust into our facilities to remember things without artificial enhancements to concepts solely for the purpose of helping us remember them. It really aims to be as lightweight as possible, by presenting a few, flexible rules that do not get in the way of your thinking.

I will propose another technique aimed at the second application for improved memory in a follow up article; to help us be better communicators of ideas by making them easy to remember. 

---

In the first and second parts of this series I have discussed the advantages of a memory system as well as proposed a simple technique for organising thinking. A particular focus of this first technique was to provide a very lightweight way to order thoughts, with minimal requirements to adorn what we want to remember and think about with artificial memory images.

However, I also mentioned that adorning our thoughts with images can have a number of advantages; specifically aid our memory but also enrich our thoughts with beauty and inspiration.

This second technique focusses on unlocking our imagination, and build imaginary worlds that we can use to convey meaning and ideas to others in a form that's that's memorable and engaging. Specifically, this technique suggests to build imaginary worlds in three layers:
## Layer 1: Landscape

We can project the ideas and concepts that we want to communicate or that we want to think about on a landscape. We can break a landscape down into different distinct components that make it easier to shape our thoughts.

 on the highest level you could imagine to have different planets that will represent different domains that you want to express.
 Then, within these planets, you may have continents for different subjects and on these continents.
 Then you can place mountains for for for specific topics of interests, but also rivers that will connect different things on this landscape and further lakes, lakes, forests, um, tundra, deserts and icy landscapes.
 And you can take these things and place them on this planet on this continent in accordance with the specific ideas that you want to convey.
 But that's just the kind of like a like a natural description of the word.

## Layer 2: Artificial Features

The landscape can  I think there needs to be another layer like a like an artificial man made layer that we can put on top of that and that again is broken up into a number of different things that we can do so firstly here we could imagine specific buildings to be on specific places on this landscape.
 But we could also imagine cities and then having these buildings and cities and other landmarks, of course, connected by roads but also railways that may be helping us to really establish connections between what we want to build up.
 This brings us brings me back to one specific, very important rule of a lot of economic systems, and that is that our brain is really good and associations and, um, that associations really help us a lot to remember things.
 And that was one of the goals of this three by three grid where really, the idea is that you take different concepts together and you associates and in this artificial space of these nine cells, but also in terms of the recursive breakdown of these that will create even more connections between things for you and likewise here.
 I think it's key for landscapes to really focus on the connecting bits that is the rivers, the roads.
 The railroads may be even a lake that may be connecting two cities and a mountain.
 And here again, if you start to imagine these places, really try to imagine the different elements in relationship to each other.
 So if you have a mountain in this city, where does where do these lie relative to each other? Is the city to the northwest of the mountain? And then what is to the south of the mountain? Is that maybe a desert or something else? Because the more you focus on these relationships between elements, the better.
 They will be as easy as a B for you to remember, but also easier to remember to those that you want to convey your I'm you're meaning to and again here should be it should be reminded.
 Like these landscapes.
 They shouldn't just be created for the sake of it, but we should ideally use them to try to capture some ideas that we have.
 So, for instance, if you're interested in Buddhist philosophy, you could, for instance, imagine that the noble eightfold path that each of its individual elements, for instance, is represented by a mountain and these mountains, you know, like some of them that are connected there may be connected through rivers or they all are adjacent to a certain landscapes, such as a tundra and so further and so on.
 And idealism to you should use a classical economics technique off, making these things more resemble what you want them to resemble.
 So, um, then look at the individual requirements of the individual items of the noble April past and try to see How can I make this mountain more like that? Maybe I can place a building onto it that represents a certain elements that I want to remember and so further and so forth.
 And really, this is not to be seen as, uh, as an alternative to the method of the three by three grid, but as a complement to it.
 So you could just as well place all the different steps of the noble eightfold path on a nine by nine grid, but then also have it represented on a landscape just creating more connections for yourself.

## Layer 3: Persons
 
It has been shown that we are really good at remembering persons and their characteristics. Building on that, we can use different persons to represent different concepts and help us to remember those better and think about them in new ways. These persons in turn are linked to the natural and artificial geographic features of the first and second layer.

 And here for each person we can first define their appearance for us and again try to make that related to the concept that you want to remember.
 But then likewise we should for these persons, imagine there and he made So first thing is appearance.
 The second thing is, and mm yeah, first thing is appearance.
 Second thing are their possessions that these persons have, and the third thing is again their their their personality, where I don't put the personality first year, although it's very important.
 But it's just in terms for us to remember things.
 I think, um, appearance and processions are much more powerful things.
 And now, of course you can.
 Into we've said with the with the imaginary landscape that you have created.
 So a person may be owning a certain building on the landscape, or there may be living on the plains that sits between two mountains.
 Oh, yeah, The one aspect that I knew I was forgetting about persons is that, um that we should also remember their relationships.
 So ideally, you should have more than one person, and then you should really focus on seeing, you know, how do these persons, interrelated and ideally again have said, correlate with the relationships between concepts that you want these persons to represent? And once again, the reminder here that this is really to be used fairly because again, it's imagining all of these things, adding all this baggage to the concept that we want to remember it comes at a price.
 And ideally, we should try to avoid that.


It should be noted here that imagining this imaginary worlds comes ahead with much higher overhead as opposed to just remembering things. Thus I do not think it is the most efficient technique to remember something, and we should really only apply it for key ideas that we really want to make very sure to remember and possibly those that we want to share with others in a way that makes it easy to remember. Another factor to consider that using our imagination is fun, and this technique, even if it is not the most efficient may be worthwhile to explore as an engaging entertainment.

But when in doubt one stick with three by three grids as much as possible so we can focus our attention on the core problems.

So that was really the overview of the system that I could come up with that I am mostly just documenting for my own reference. But I will try this out for a while, and hopefully I'll be able to report back on how I went with it and likely will have a few improvements
