There is some solid, if straighforward, advice in this book on public speaking and communicating in general, such as to keep it short and to focus on one main point.

Unfortunately this advice was not heeded in the composition of this book itself. I would suggest to follow another piece of advice offered in the book; read things that are well-written to have their influence seep into your own writing, and in the interest of that, stay well away from On Speaking Well.
