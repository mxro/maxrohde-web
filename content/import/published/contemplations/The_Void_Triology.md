I do quite enjoy the genre of Science Fiction literature labelled Space Opera, such as the the all famous Star Wars or the Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons. The Void Triology by Peter Hamilton falls very much within this fold, a story that spans a galaxy, civilisations and ages. I actually think that the term 'opera' here, notwithstanding the grandeur of this art form, falls short of capturing the scope of what the authors seek out to achieve here. It is more like an epic or a legend, or in fact often a multiple of these.


What I enjoyed most in the Void Triology, and what sets it aparts from other similar works, is that it is in effect two individual, distinc stories and worlds wrapped into one epic work. One of these stories resembles traditional fantasy much more than Science Fiction (including a young male protagonist who leaves their hometown village to find adventure in the world, midieval technology and magic), while the other is very much more Science Fiction with galatic empires and space ships. There is first a tenouus link between these, which predicatbly is later brought to a convergence. 

The questions lying at the heart of both these stories are profound; life after death, what is the ultimate goal of existence, can nearly unlimited power and immortality bring us lasting happiness and satisfaction, and what is good government.

Central here is the character of Edeard, who learns that he has very strong magical powers. Powers so strong in fact that he can become the ultimate ruler of a people (without them being aware of being ruled) and become immortal. He struggles with how to apply these powers so that the people he influences are happy and protected, but repeatedly to fail to do so and causes great suffering. Moreover, he finds that in the interests of bringing about his vision of a happy and good society, he needs to commit many immoral acts and crimes, including murder.

I find these problems Edeard is facing quite fascinating, and I think we are very blessed that in some countries these days, many (certainly not all) people can lead safe and fulfilled lives in a society close to the one Edeard ultemately brings about. However, of course likewise these protected lives nowadays are also based on crimes, exploitation and murder (for some account of this, I would recommend Empire of Cotton).

Another interesting central theme is the idea of life after death and immortality. Essentially in the universe created for the Void triology, something very close to our traditional idea of heaven exist. A place where souls travel after death and can henceforth linger in eternity. However, it is brought up how desirable such an eternal existence may really be and what a reasonable price is to achieve it.

Overall the Void Triology is well-written, engaging, and thought-provoking and it is very good that the three books in the series are as long as they are.
