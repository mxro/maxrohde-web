I have recently been reading a number of books on memory techniques, namely so far [The Art of Memory by Frances Yates](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4371670825) and How to Remember Anything by by Dean Vaughn. Moonwalking with Einstein by Josh Foer provides a nice complement to these books; The Art of Memory is very academic and has a historical perspective, while How to Remember Anything is focussed on just giving practical advise. Moonwalking with Einstein takes a journalistic angle to memory techniques, rooted in reporting on modern practitioners of memory techniques, with a bit of theory and history mixed in.

Moonwalking with Einstein is very well written and easy to read. Here some of the points I found most notable from my reading of it:

- When we learn something new, we will forget a large chunk of it very quickly, but over time the speed at which we forget reduces. This is quite heartening since this means that if we learn something new and we spend a relatively short amount of concentrated effort on it (focussing on what we forget), there is a good chance that we will have long-lasting memories of what we have learned.
- We remember things in context; the more connections we can build between what we already know with what we want to learn, the easier it will be for us to remember. Because of this, it is very easy for experts to remember knowledge and information related to their field. Chess players, for instance, can memorise Chess positions easily since they can relate them to patterns, strategies and other knowledge related to positions. This only works for Chess positions though that resulted from actual games. They cannot remember positions in which the pieces where arrange randomly (at least not better than people who do not play chess).
- It is easier for us to remember something when we visualise it as a vivid image. The more engaging and arousing the image is, the easier it is for us to remember. Almost all memory techniques provide ways to turn abstract knowledge and concepts into images. For instance by coming up with a sound-alike word for an abstract concept, or by turning numbers into words by associating certain numbers with certain sounds. One particularly clever technique is used by memory artist that was described was the _person, action, object_ method. For instance, for all numbers from 00-99 a person, action and object are defined, such as for the number 12 one may have Michael Jordan eating a basketball, for 23 Captain Picard blowing up a Borg cube with a phaser and for 56 Gandhi weaving a cotton shirt. Then the number 12 23 56 can be turned into the image by taking the person from the first number, the action from the second and the object from the third, in our case here Michael Jordan disintegrating a cotton shirt with a phaser. These images are then placed into physical or imagined locations for which the memory artist has remembered their order, and even large numbers such as 194624873401 can be remembered with just two images.
- Systems such as the _person, action, object_ method do not lend themselves very well for remembering prose. For this purpose, actors use something called Method acting, a technique for which the actor associates the emotions of the speaker in every part of the sentence. For instance, "I didn't know you were coming." maybe linked to the emotions of surprise, disdain, detachment, etc. This helps in remembering what is said since it provides additional contextual information to what has to be remember (and also is useful for actors to act out the emotions of course).
- Deliberate practice (something I think I first learned about in the [The Little Book of Talent by Daniel Coyle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13330702-the-little-book-of-talent)) has been identified as the key practice followed by all kinds of experts. The idea of deliberate practice is to be mindful about which behaviours to do automatically, without thinking, and which behaviours to break down and work out how to improve. For instance, most of us will probably go about washing the dishes without thinking much about it; in consequence, we are very unlikely to get any better at it - even if we do it a lot. If we were to focus on different aspects of washing the dishes from time to time and come up with ideas of how to improve them, we are much more likely to become experts at washing the dishes eventually. The key elements of deliberate practice are focus on technique, setting clear goals and getting constant and immediate feedback on our performance (to know what works and what doesn't).
- Memory can be argued to be an important enabler of creativity and virtue. After all, new ideas are spawned from existing knowledge (that must be in our heads for the magic of creativity to happen) and our actions are also moderated by what we know.

In school, I was always strongly opposed to having to memorise anything: which did result in many a poor mark in vocabulary and grammar tests. In my last year at school, I came across a mind map book by Tony Buzan (there are so many of these, I won't be able to tell which one exactly I read), which first motivated me to try to learn some things by heart. This also motivated me to start exploring ways in which software can be used to help us form better memories (rather than just being an externalised memory crutch for us), something I pursued all the way to my PhD thesis. Overall I find memory techniques quite interesting but I agree with the concluding thoughts in Moonwalking with Einstein; that many of these techniques are of dubious value in every day life; but that becoming more mindful and interested in ways in which we can learn and remember more can be of great benefit to us.
