title: Italian Herbed Tempeh
---

I must admit, I'm not a huge fan of beans. According to Dr Greger though, we must have multiple servings of beans every day. In comes tempeh to the rescue. It's made from beans and is minimally processed, and it tastes great!

This herbed tempeh is very versatile. It is great as a toping on pasta dishes, in wraps and over rice dishes for that extra protein and meaty-ness. You can also crumble it and add it to a pasta sauce.
