title: Easy Tofu Scramble
---

![IMG_4115](images/img_4115.jpg)

Before we adopted a whole food plant based diet, we used to love eating scrambled eggs. I made it often and I had perfected it! I really miss eating scrambled eggs and have been looking for a good substitute for a LONG time.

I wanted my scrambled 'eggs' to be soft and moist. I also wanted to replicate the style my mum used to make when I was little - with tomatoes, onion and cumin. And so this recipe was born.

This tofu scramble is:

- Easy to make
- Uses ingredients that you most likely will have already
- Is really versatile and forgiving - if you don't have some of the ingredients, or want to experiment with other things instead, feel free to substitute!
- Soft
- Moist
- Flavourful

Inspired by [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/southwest-tofu-scramble/)'s recipe.

Servings: 3

## Ingredients

- 1 block of extra firm tofu (350g), crumbled (you can just crumble it with your fingers!)
- 1/2 onion, chopped
- 1 tomato, chopped
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp of cumin seeds
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
- Salt & pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup soy milk
- 1 tsp dijon mustard

## Method

1. Heat the oil in a pan. Add 1/2 tsp of cumin seeds and let it sputter for just a few seconds.
2. Add the onions and cook it until the onions are soft.
3. Add 1/2 tsp of turmeric powder and the chopped tomato.
4. Continue cooking until the tomatoes are soft.
5. Add the tofu and stir to combine well. Cook the tofu for a few minutes - it does not really matter how long, just until the tofu has a nice texture that you like.
6. In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 1/2 tsp of turmeric, 1/4 tsp smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, salt to your taste (I used around 3/4 tsp), 1/2 cup soy milk, 1 tsp dijon mustard and 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast.
7. Mix the tofu well with the liquid/spice mixture and cook the tofu for a minute or so. Add some freshly ground pepper (optional).
8. Enjoy!
