title: Creamy Tahini Maple Dressing
---

This sauce is creamy, a little sweet from the maple syrup, with a hint of acidity from the apple cider vinegar. It pairs wonderfully with our [Chickpea, Sweet Potato and RocketÂ Salad](https://shalveena.com/2020/09/19/chickpea-sweet-potato-and-rocket-salad/). And, to top it off, it is oil free!

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp tahini paste
- 3 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup unsweetened plant milk (I used almond milk)
- 1/2 Tbsp maple syrup
- 1 clove garlic, finely diced
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Method

Mix everything together in a small bowl. That's it!
