title: Cannellini Bean Salad with Avocado and Sweet Tomatoes
---

I've been trying to include more beans in out meals, but I'm not a huge bean fan so it's proving difficult! But I've found the perfect, quick, easy and delicious bean salad. And to my disbelief, I even found myself craving this one day! ðŸ˜²

## Ingredients

- 1 can cannellini beans, drained

- 1/2 avocado, chopped

- 8 - 10 snacking tomatoes, quartered

- 1/8 - 1/4 onion (or to your taste. I don't like raw onion too much so I only put a tiny bit in)

- fresh coriander, chopped

- 1 Tbsp olive oil

- 1/2 Tbsp red wine vinegar (you can probably substitute with apple cider vinegar or sherry vinegar)

- Juice of half a lemon

- 1/2 tsp salt (taste and add more at the end if needed)

- 1/8 tsp of sumac

## Method

1. Finely chop the onions then put it into a small bowl. Add the vinegar and lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Mix it together and set aside.

3. In a large salad bowl, add the beans, avocado, tomatoes and corriander. Add the chopped onions. Add the olive oil, salt and sumac.

5. Mix everything together and you're done!
