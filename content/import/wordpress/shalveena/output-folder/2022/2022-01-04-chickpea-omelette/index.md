title: Chickpea Omelette
---

Servings: 1

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup dry chickpea flour mixture (see below)
- Approx. 2 Tbsp chopped vegetables of your choice (I used red onions, capsicum, and mushrooms)
- A bit less than 1/2 cup soy milk
- Vegan cheese (optional)
- Baby spinach (optional)

#### Dry Chickpea flour mixture

- 2 cups of chickpea flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black salt (kala namak)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder (heaped)
- 1 tsp dried chopped chives

Note: The above recipe makes a lot of dry chickpea flour mix. We couldn't use all of it between two people, so I stored it in a glass jar for next time :)

## Method

1. Heat a non-stick pan over medium high heat.
2. While the pan is heating, mix 1/4 cup of the dry chickpea flour mixture and just under 1/2 cup of soy milk in a medium bowl. Mix well so that there are no clumps.
3. Add the chopped veggies and mix again.
4. Pour a small drop of oil on the pan and mix it all around to coat the pan. Then, add the chickpea flour & soy milk mixture into the pan. Let it cook undisturbed for about 3 minutes and then flip. You'll know it's time to flip when the mixture starts to sort of look a bit dry on the top side, and gets firm.
5. Cook for approx 2 minutes on the other side. If you're not adding the cheese and/or spinach then you can just cook it for a further minute and then it's ready to eat :)
6. If you are adding the spinach & cheese, flip the omelette after the 2 minutes and then add cheese and spinach on top. Let it cook for a minute or so, then fold one side over the other to make it into a half circle.
7. Flip and let it cook on the other side for a minute, then it's ready to eat :)
