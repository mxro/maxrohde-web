Max and I cook quite a bit at home, and eat out very seldom. When we cook, we tend to become more aware of what goes on our plate and into our bodies. And we therefore start to eat healthier too. Plus, cooking at home tends to be more healthy as we use less oil and no additives and all the bad things :)

This was our dinner tonight, yummy! I tend to cook more by taste, and generally use ingredients that are available in the house.

**The Ingredients**  
  
Half of a large onion, sliced
