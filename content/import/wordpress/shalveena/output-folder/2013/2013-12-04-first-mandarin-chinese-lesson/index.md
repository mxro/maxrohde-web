Learning new languages is amazing. It brings with it not only the language itself, but the whole culture of the people who speak it. So learning a new language, getting to know a new culture, exploring and growing is a wonderful opportunity.  
  
I was very happy to have our first Mandarin Chinese lesson at work yesterday, to help us understand better the culture of our clients, of the country, and to help us provide better service.  
  
This post is a copy and expansion of my notes from the lesson:  
  
We first explored what comes to mind when we think of China and here is what we came up with:  
  
\- Busy  
_Máng_ 忙  
  
\- History  
_Lìshǐ_ 历史  
  
\- Hong Kong  
_Xiānggǎng_ 香港  
  
\- Culture  
_Wénhuà_ 文化  
  
\- Pollution  
_Wūrǎn_ 污染  
  
Then we learnt to introduce ourselves and some basic words:  
  
I am \[Shalveena\]  
_Wǒ_ _Shì_ \[Shalveena\]

I am also \[Shalveena\]

_Qing cai_  
What is this  
_Zhè shì shénme_

Lastly, we learnt some words that sounded similar to their English version:
