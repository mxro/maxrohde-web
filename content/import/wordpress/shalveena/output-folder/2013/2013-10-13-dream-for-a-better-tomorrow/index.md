What is motivation?Â 

  

It is but a dream to achieve our dreams. Ah, but it is more. It is a desire. So strong a desire that it drives us to do the otherwise mundane tasks of everyday. To work towards our dreams.

  

How to find this motivation is the question to ask. And yes it is asked so very often. Because we all need motivation in our life, to drive forward and face another tomorrow. But no, not just to face another tomorrow - to see it as an opportunity to get one day, one step, closer to that dream.

  

Motivation. A desire to see a better me, a better you, a better us. A desire to be our dream.
