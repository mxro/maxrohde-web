title: Satay Peanut Noodles
---

This dish is just the right amount of hot, spicy & sweet. Perfect for Summer :)  
  
I've tried lots of peanut butter noodles recipes, but didn't find any that hit the spot just right. It would either be too peanut buttery, too sweet, or too saltyâ€¦.  
So, I created my own. It's super simple, quick to make, filling and really yummy. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

### Serves: 2 - 3

## Ingredients

- Fresh noodles of your choice (we used 250 grams of flour noodles for 2 people)
- 2 Tbsp peanut butter (we used natural, crunchy peanut butter made with 100% peanuts)
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp sambal oelek or chilli garlic sauce
- 1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 1 clove of garlic, finely diced
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 3 to 4 Tbsp of warm water
- Optional: fresh grated ginger
- Toppings (optional): cucumber, chopped peanuts, edamame beans, toasted sesame seeds, spring onions

## Method

1. In a medium bowl, mix together all the ingredients (except for the noodles and optional toppings).
2. Cook the noodles as per package instructions.
3. Mix noodles and sauce together.
4. Add toppings and enjoy!
