title: Creamy Steel Cut Oats with Fruits
---

This breakfast is SOOOO yummy and healthy. It's one of our go-to breakfasts. In fact, we eat it almost every other day ðŸ˜„

### Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 3 cups of boiling water
- 2/3 cups of steel cut oats
- a generous splash of unsweetened soy milk
- 1 Tbsp maple syrup
- toppings: handful of chopped nuts of your choice, chopped fresh kiwifruit, frozen berries, cacao nibs
- optional extra: 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of honey per bowl.

## Method

1. Pour 3 cups of boiled water into a medium sized pot. Bring it back to the boil. Once it is boiling, add 2/3 cups of steel cut oats. Let it boil for about 2 minutes. Then, lower the heat (to the lowest setting), partly cover the pot - taking care to leave a bit of a gap so the oats don't overflow - and let it gently simmer for 20 minutes.
2. While the oats are cooking, chop the nuts (I use a small handful each of almonds, cashews and walnuts). Chop any fresh fruits you're using (I usually have 2 kiwifruit and sometimes from strawberries too).
3. After the 20 minutes, uncover the oats, stir, add 1 Tbsp of maple syrup and a generous splash of soy milk (I guestimate around 1/3 cup). Stir well and then partly cover the pot again and cook for another 10 minutes.
4. After 10 minutes, turn off the stove, stir the oats once again and then pour it into two bowls. I like to add a touch of honey to my bowl at this stage and mix well (Max doesn't like his one as sweet so I omit it from his). You can add the toppings in whichever order you like, but I do it as follows:
    - First, I add frozen raspberries (I like to crumble my raspberries so they are evenly spread out over the oats);
    - Add kiwifruit;
    - Add chopped nuts;
    - Add frozen blueberries (I add these last because I don't like my frozen blueberries to thaw because of the heat from the warm oats);
    - Finally, I add some cacao nibs, and it's ready!
