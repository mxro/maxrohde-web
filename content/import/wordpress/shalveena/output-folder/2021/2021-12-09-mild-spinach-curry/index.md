title: Mild Spinach Curry
---

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp vegetable or olive oil
- 1/2 large onion, chopped
- 4 cloves of garlic, finely diced
- 1/2 tsp cumin powder
- 1/2 tsp heaped turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp coriander powder
- 1 inch fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 1/4 tsp garam masala
- 2 tsp tomato paste
- 1 bunch fresh spinach
- salt and pepper to taste
- fresh coriander (to taste, optional)

## Method

1. Heat oil in a frying pan on medium heat. Add the onions and fry for a few minutes, until the onions start to turn golden.
2. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for another minute, until garlic is fragrant and no longer raw.
3. Reduce heat to low then add the spices - cumin powder, turmeric, coriander powder and garam masala. Stir well to mix all the spices together and let it cook for just a few seconds. Be careful here as the spice powders can burn quickly. Add a bit of water if needed, to stop the spices from sticking to the pan and burning.
4. Add the tomato paste, mix well to combine with the spices and cook for a few seconds.
5. Add the spinach, increase heat to medium again and cook until the spinach is cooked to your liking. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I used just over 1/4 tsp salt). Finally, add the coriander, give it a stir, and you're done!
6. Enjoy!

**Notes:**  
Recipe adapted from [Erren's Kitchen](https://www.errenskitchen.com/sag-bahji-spinach-curry/comment-page-5/#comments). I reduced the spices called for in the original recipe because we discovered that Max's tummy doesn't do well with all the spices - especially chilli (which is in most masalas!).
