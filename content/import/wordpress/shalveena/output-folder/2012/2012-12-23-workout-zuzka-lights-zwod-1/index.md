---

This is my fitness journey. It is not always straight - that is to say it does not always follow a straight path - sometimes it goes one step forward then one step (sometimes two) back. Sometimes it goes in leaps and bounds but other times it twists around corners and tries to form a new path. But always, overall, it moves towards the end goal.  
  
Last week, I tried to do yoga but, as mentioned in the last [post](http://www.shalveena.com/2012/12/reflections-and-resolutions.html), that was a step not entirely in the right direction. So, tis time for a change of direction. This week (and onwards), I want to do short, hard workouts instead.  
  
On previous occassions, I have tried Zuzana Light's workouts and have greatly enjoyed them. So I'll be starting with her ZWOD exercises. Here is the first one:
