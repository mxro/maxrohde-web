I have been wanting to record the foods we eat at home as a collection on cooking ideas. Finally, here is the first recipe:  
[Healthy eating: Easy salad](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s230//sh/e83c2b4f-c58c-463c-8bb9-fbd0873085c7/14a3e8904781c3296842a16cbae7d0ad)

Nothing wrong with start easy :-P

It is so very important to eat healthy, no matter what age or stage of life we are in. Despite this very basic understanding though, healthy cooking often gets left behind, for various reasons: no time, habits, it my not be what you are used to eating at home, etc etc. But it is so true that we are what we eat - why should we put anything other than good healthy foods into our bodies? I mean after all, our bodies are the most important asset w have, and will have in our life!
