I spend a not so insignificant amount of time watching movies - Bollywood movies to be precise so I have decided to write a little bit about some of the movies that I watched recently. Some are great and some others, which I thought were good at the time, upon watching it again I realise I don't particularly like it.

One movie that I recently watched was called Taal. It was set in a small village n the mountains and I quite enjoyed it - the scenery. The songs, the dances. It brought a kind of peaceful setting and motivates that e can be great at what we are passionate about - with hard work and perseverance.

I did not particularly want to watch his movie but I was pleasantly surprised by it. It is one of those movies that you want and then you wish you hadn't finished watching it yet so you could watch it again. Though I have to say that the first half was much nicer than the second half - the characters needed o be developed more, but on the whole a good and motivating movie.
