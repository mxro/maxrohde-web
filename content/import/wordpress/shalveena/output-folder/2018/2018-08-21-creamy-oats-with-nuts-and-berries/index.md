title: Creamy Oats with Nuts and Berries
---

I posted our favourite [overnight chia seed pudding recipe](http://shalveena.com/2018/03/16/overnight-chia-seed-pudding/)Â a while back, which is Max's absolute favourite weekday breakfast. BUT, I find that to be toooooooo cold to eat on a freezing cold Winter's morning. Especially since we wake up when it is still dark outside!

So I went looking (experimenting) with different, warm, things that I could have for breakfast. And, BEHOLD, the most delicious, comforting, healthy and delectable breakfast recipe was created. Warm, creamy, soft oats topped with delicious, sweet blueberries and tarty raspberries, with chopped nuts and seeds to top it all off. It is heavenly! This is my favourite breakfast at the moment. I even feel like eating it on the weekends!

The warm oats and cold berries make a really, really nice combination and the textures added by the nuts....mmmmmm....just devine.
