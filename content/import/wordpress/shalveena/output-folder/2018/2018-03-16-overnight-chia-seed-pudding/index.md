title: Overnight Chia Seed Pudding
---

This is the breakfast that we enjoy every week-day. It's a healthy, goodness filled breakfast that keeps me going through the day without needing to snack until lunch! It's filled with awesomeness from chia, peanut butter, and fruits. It's easy to prepare, and delicious.
