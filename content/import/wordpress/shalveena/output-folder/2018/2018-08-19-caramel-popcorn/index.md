title: Caramel Popcorn
---

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup popcorn kernels
- 4 tbsp (60ml) olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1-2 tsp maple syrup
- 2 heaped tbsp vegan butter
- 1 handful salted peanuts, chopped/crushed

## Preparation

1. Heat oil in a large pot on low/medium heat and add in a few popcorn kernels. Once there are little bubbles around the kernels add in the rest and toss to coat then close the lid
2. You might not hear much popping at the start but don't worry. Toss the popcorn frequently to ensure all the kernels touch the bottom of the pot at some point. Don't open it until the popping comes close to a stop
3. Transfer the popcorn to a large dish and season with salt
4. In a small saucepan add the butter, sugar and maple syrup. Stir until the butter has melted completely then add in the peanuts.
5. Drizzle "caramel" mixture over popcorn and mix it in
