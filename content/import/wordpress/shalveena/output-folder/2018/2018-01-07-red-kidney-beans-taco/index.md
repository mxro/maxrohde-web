title: Red Kidney Beans Taco
---

On those days when I feel like eating something fresh, crunchy, but also warm and filling, tacos hit just the spot. They are so easy to prepare and the best thing is that I can put anything that I have in the fridge. If I don't have a particular vegetable, I can replace it with another. With the exception of beans.....for me, tacos **must** have beans (probably since we can't have meat).

When I first thought about making tacos on a vegan diet, I couldn't think of what to use instead of meat. Then, as I became more familiar with vegan cooking, I found that if you add certain spices to beans they taste more 'meaty' and can totally hold their own.

I really love cumin. The smell, the taste....mmmmmmm. Added to these beans, they really transform the beans to something else. **And** the slightly spiced, warm, tomatoe-y beans are a perfect match to put into the crunchy tacos.
