title: Thai-Style Turmeric-Coconut Soup
---

Today and the day before yesterday Shalveena has not been feeling very well. She was in a lot of pain; probably caused by inflammation. She thus had to temporarily yield her primary domain, the kitchen, for a few days. The following soup I cooked with the objective to reduce inflammation (Turmeric, Garlic, Cauliflower) and reduce pain (Ginger).
