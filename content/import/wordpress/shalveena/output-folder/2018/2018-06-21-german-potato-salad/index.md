title: German Potato Salad
---

We went to a German restaurant, which served Bavarian style dishes, a couple of weeks ago with some visiting friends. Unfortunately, it seems that Bavarian cuisine is a bit light on the vegetarian/vegan dishes, but when we asked which dishes were vegan/could be made vegan, we were surprised to hear that the potato salad was vegan. Ah?! No mayonnaise in it?? Yes, yes, yes! It appears that some German potato salads have no mayonnaise! Instead, it is made using vinegar and herbs.

The potato salad we got was creamy and a little tangy. It was really yum.

I decided to recreate it.

Of course, having no clue about German cuisine, I asked my friend Google for help. Sadly, though, it seems Google was a little bit lost when it came to finding German potato salad recipes without meat or animal products. (Yes, Max IS German, but he is not a big fan of German food - or so he tells me - and he has not much of an idea how to make it either!)

Luckily, I found [this](http://susikochenundbacken.blogspot.com/2010/07/oma-ingrids-german-potato-salad.html?m=1) and [this](https://www.eyecandypopper.com/german-style-potato-salad-vegan-no-mayonnaise/) recipe, which I used as a reference point when making the salad. It turned out delicious and, you know what, it was super healthy (well, as far as potatoes go)!
