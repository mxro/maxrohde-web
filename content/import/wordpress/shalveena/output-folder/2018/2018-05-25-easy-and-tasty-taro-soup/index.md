title: Easy and Tasty Taro Soup
---

Today was one of those days. I felt tired of cooking all week and wanted to have something easy for dinner. It's winter. It's cold in our house. It was dark outside. It was a day for soup. But not just any soup, a soup that would require little time and work!

I also wanted to broaden our range of foods beyond just rice and pasta, and so I thought, hey, I have some frozen taro in the fridge, let's use that! Instantly, what came to my mind was some yummy mutton soup with taro (or dalo as they call it back in Fiji). But alas, no mutton on a vegan lifestyle. And so I veganised the soup :)

I used our [super healthy and yummy vegetable stock](http://shalveena.com/2018/01/06/home-made-vegetable-stock/), which I always keep in the fridge for just such days. It turned out really tasty and was so easy to make. AND it is healthy and has no oil! AND it all comes together in just one pot. Win, win and win!

I used the vegetables that I had in my fridge, but this is a soup where you can easily substitute the veggies here for whatever you have on hand. I think some carrots would go nicely in this soup, but I didn't have any today. Maybe you could also use some onions instead of onion powder. Feel free to play around with it and make it your own.
