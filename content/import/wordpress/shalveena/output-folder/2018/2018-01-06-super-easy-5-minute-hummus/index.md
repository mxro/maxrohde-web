Since going vegan I have been trying to make a lot of things at home, one of those things being hummus. Out of all the recipes I have found, every single one has had tonnes of tahini in it and the thing is, I _really_ don't like tahini! But without it the hummus just doesn't taste right... So one day I had an epiphany, could I use less tahini and still get the same results? YES, you most certainly can. And that's how this recipe came about; it is pretty much identical to [this recipe from Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/best-ever-5-minute-microwave-hummus/) but with less than half of the tahini.

## Ingredients

- 1 can chickpeas, not drained
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1/2 lemon, juiced (~2 tbsp juice)
- 2 tbsp tahini
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil

## Preparation

1. Add garlic and chickpeas to a large microwave safe container and microwave for 4 minutes. (I usually do it in 1 minute increments otherwise it makes really strange popping sounds)
2. In a food processor add in all remaining ingredients except the oil and pulse, slowly streaming in the olive oil
3. Once the mixture is smooth and creamy you can transfer it into a mason jar. At this point the hummus will be somewhat runny, if you prefer thicker hummus you can refrigerate it overnight or drain out some of the liquid before microwaving.

The hummus can be stored for up to a week in the fridge.
