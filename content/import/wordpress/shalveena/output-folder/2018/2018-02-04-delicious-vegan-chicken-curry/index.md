title: Delicious Vegan "Chicken" Curry
---

One of the very first dishes that I tried to make when I moved out of home was chicken curry. I'm an a BIG chicken curry FAN. Mmmmmm....the smell when it is cooking, the flavours, the gravy, ah, no words can describe or do it justice.

You can imagine, then, how I missed having chicken curry when we became vegan. It was one of the few things I missed. It's not really the chicken that I missed, but the flavour and texture it lent to the curry itself.

I tried so many different recipes from the internet. First, I tried to make it with soya chunks using recipes that looked 'authentic' from old Indian ladies. That was a complete and utter failure. I don't know what exactly I did wrong but the soya chunks were all soft and squished on the outside but still hard and uncooked inside. It also had the terrible,  strong, smell that soya chunks have (or maybe that's just me being picky?).

Then, I discovered that there was a buzz about [Gardien Chick'n Scallopini](https://gardein.com/products/chickn-scallopini/) and apparently it had the texture of chicken and lent itself well to curries. I stalked the only online store that I found that sold this product in Victoria, Australia. They were out of stock for many weeks (months?). I was ecstatic when, one day, I logged on to see they were in stock! I ordered 2 packs straight away. One is still sitting in my freezer (from before Christmas). I guess that tells you something already. Yeah, it didn't go so well. The 'chicken' was so soft and yet not really. It tasted like nothing. Well, no that's not true, it tasted like processed food. Not great. This time, I also tried a Fijian Indian recipe from the internet (since the ones from the old Indian ladies hadn't worked out so well last time). Again, a fail. It was way too spicy (and trust me, I love spicy and add cayenne pepper to all my food!). The masala didn't come together like it should - I could feel the grainy texture still.

Then, I gave up.

I decided to just cook a curry my way, just like I used to cook real chicken curry, but just substitute the chicken for soya chunks. I decided to give the soya chunks another chance. Mostly because Max really loves them and a few days before I had used them in a tomato based sauce that actually turned out quite good.

So anyway, I made the curry as normal and then put the soya chunks in. I didn't want the soya chunks to be uncooked again so I boiled it for about 5 minutes in water until it doubled in size then ran it under cold water for a few minutes, then squeezed the water out before putting it in the curry to cook (I got this from [this blog post](http://www.7aumsuvai.com/2015/03/kitchen-secrets-how-to-cook-soya-chunks.html)). The exact instructions for the curry are below.

I hope you love it as much as I did. In fact, my whole family (and non-vegan relatives) loved it and wanted to take home leftovers!

PS, I've made this dish a few times now with great success, so it's been tried and tested :)

So, without further a-do, here is my Delicious Vegan 'Chicken' Curry:
