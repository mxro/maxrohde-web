title: Vegan Iced Coffee (Kind of Healthy)
---

The great blue skies brought a pleasant 42 degrees Celsius to Melbourne's West today and everybody felt kind of ... hot! Now my dear wife does not like cooled water, so our only sources of hydration are usually room-temperature warm filtered water or hot beverages. I decided that today we needed a real cold drink: iced coffee!

Now, as you may know, the two main ingredients in iced coffee are ... well ... coffee and ice cream. The former of which we don't drink in our quest to avoid caffeine and the latter we avoid since it contains dairy. But I let this not deter me and came up with the following:

| Name | Vegan Iced Coffe |

### Ingredients

- 4 teaspoons of Caro Cafe (we use [Nature's Cuppa Rich Roast](http://naturescuppa.com/organictea/product/coffee-alternative-caffeine-free/))
- 1 1/2 cups of ice cubes, crushed (or whole if you don't have a way to crush them or just feel lazy)
- 1 cup of unsweetened soy milk
- 1 cup of cold tap water
- 3 teaspoons of sugar (more if you like)

### Preparation

1. Put 1/2 cup of cold tap water and the Caro Cafe into a mug and mix thoroughly
2. Add crushed ice
3. Add soy milk
4. Add sugar
5. Add remaining water (1/2 cup)
6. Mix well
7. Divide into four cups and enjoy

Not too difficult, is it? And, as it turns out, quite delicious!
