title: Spicy Baked Beans

When I first arrived in New Zealand 10 years ago, one of the things which startled me was the breakfast. I lived in an all-inclusive student accommodation and for better or worse had to eat whatever was given to me. I quickly settled on a winning combination of white toast and baked beans, neither of which I ate before in my life.

But there was always something which bothered me about baked beans and that is that they are sweet. I don't particularly like sweet things and sugar is not exactly healthy either. So one day I decided to try to make my own baked beans; and to make them spicy. This experiment turned out surprisingly well and spicy baked beans have become a staple of our breakfast ever since their inception.
