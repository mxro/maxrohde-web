title: Vegan Meatball Soup
---

In our family, there are a good many soup lovers and initially we were quite uncertain if we could make vegan soups which taste as good as those made with meat. Thankfully, we discovered a great way to make [healthy, delicious vegetable stock](http://shalveena.com/2018/01/06/home-made-vegetable-stock/) which we found to be a great starting point for making soups. This simple soup is based on this stock and also features soy chunks as great meatball replacements. Enjoy!
