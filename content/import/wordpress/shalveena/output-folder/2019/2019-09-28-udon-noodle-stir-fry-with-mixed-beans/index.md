My poor wife had to work very long hours one day last week and so I got command of the kitchen again. I cooked up something _interesting_Â since I wanted to use both udon noodles and beans. Anyway, it didn't taste all too bad and thus I present here without further ado the recipe:

## Ingredients

- 270 g Udon Noodles
- 400 g White Button Mushrooms, quartered
- 3 bunches of baby Bok Choi, sliced in half
- 1 can of Mexican Mixed Means (Red Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, Black Beans)
- 8 cloves of Garlic, chopped
- 1 small Red Onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoon Kikoman Soy Sauce
- 1 tablespoon Canola Oil
- 2 teaspoons Rice Wine Vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Cooking Sake
- 1 teaspoon Sesame Oil

## Preparation

- Heat canola oil in a large wok or frying pan
- Fry onion on low heat for 5-7 minutes, until it starts to brown
- Fry garlic for 2-4 minutes, until it starts to brown
- Add mushrooms, slightly increase heat and fry for 2 minutes
- Cook udon noodles as per instruction in a separate saucepan
- Add soy sauce, Rice Wine Vinegar and Cooking Sake and increase heat to medium high, cook mushrooms and sauce for 8 minutes
- Add beans and cook for another 2 minutes
- Add bok choy and cook for 3 minutes
