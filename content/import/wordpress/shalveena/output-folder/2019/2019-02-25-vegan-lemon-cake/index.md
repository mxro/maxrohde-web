title: Vegan Lemon Cake
---

Way before I went vegan I used to love baking up sweet treats for myself and the family, one of our favourites was this super moist lemon cake that I made a few times. But after becoming vegan I pretty much stopped baking because I didn't know how to make anything without using eggs. A few days ago I was seriously craving some sugar and was feeling inspired to finally hit the kitchen and try to veganise my lemon cake recipe. Spoiler alert: it was a huge hit with the fam :))

## Ingredients:

**Cake** 2 1/2 cups plain flour 1 cup sugar 1 cup applesauce (I used a sweetened one) 3 tsp baking powder 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (~3 oranges) 1 cup olive oil 3 tsp lemon juice

**Glaze** 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (~8 lemons) 250 g icing sugar

## Directions:

1. Grease and lightly flour bundt cake pan
2. Mix all cake ingredients in a cake mixer (you could do it my hand it'll just take a while). The mixture will probably fizz up, don't worry it's normal. Keep mixing until the batter is smooth with no lumps
3. Transfer to the greased pan and bake at 150 C for about 45 mins to 1 hour. Check every 20 mins or so with a skewer, it's done when the tester comes out clean
4. Meanwhile, mix the glaze ingredients together with a whisk and place it in a jug with a spout
5. Remove the cake from the oven and with a chopstick, or something of a similar size, poke holes into the cake making sure not to reach the bottom
6. Slowly pour about half of the glaze over the holes and let sit for 15 mins
7. Flip the cake onto a plate and gently remove from the pan
8. Pour the remaining glaze over the cake and let sit for another 15 mins then you're done!
