title: Vegan Tofu Spaghetti Bolognese
---

We LOVEEEEEEE spaghetti bolognese and it is one of the few things that we were really sad to say goodbye to when we stopped eating meat. BUT, I just couldn't accept it. I searched the internet for vegan versions and came across very many, but none sounded just right. Lentils didn't appeal. Then, I came across a recipe on [It Doesn't Taste Like Chicken](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/tofu-bolognese/) and it was just the thing that I was looking for. I adapted the recipe and our new favourite was born.

The tofu is so SO DELICIOUS that I can eat it just by itself. It tastes a bit like popcorn chicken but better! I actually reckon this version tastes better than the version I used to make with mince meat (beef/pork/chicken).

**I seriously love this dish. We all do!**
