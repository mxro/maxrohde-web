title: Vegan Tofu Spaghetti Bolognese
---

We LOVEEEEEEE spaghetti bolognese and it is one of the few things that we were really sad to say goodbye to when we stopped eating meat. BUT, I just couldn't accept it. I searched the internet for vegan versions and came across very many, but none sounded just right. Lentils didn't appeal. Then, I came across a recipe on [It Doesn't Taste Like Chicken](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/tofu-bolognese/) and it was just the thing that I was looking for. I adapted the recipe and our new favourite was born.

The tofu is so SO DELICIOUS that I can eat it just by itself. It tastes a bit like popcorn chicken but better! I actually reckon this version tastes better than the version I used to make with mince meat (beef/pork/chicken).

**I seriously love this dish. We all do!**

## Ingredients

For the sauce:

- 1 small onion, chopped
- 6-8 garlic cloves, diced
- 1 large carrot, finely diced
- 1-2 stalks celery, finely diced
- 700g passata (tomato puree)
- 1 pack wholegrain spaghetti
- Fresh basil
- Fresh chilli, sliced
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- Salt (to taste)
- Pepper (to taste)

For the tofu:

- 1 tbsp soy sauce (I used Kikkoman)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper (or use any other chilli powder)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 pack (350g) extra firm tofu

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 180 C
2. Drain and crumble the tofu (no need to press). Mix remaining tofu ingredients together in a large bowl and add in the crumbled tofu
3. Line a baking sheet and spread the tofu in a single layer. Bake for 30-40 minutes, stirring every 10 mins to ensure that all sides are nicely browned
4. Heat about 1 tbsp of canola oil in a pan then add onions and cook until soft
5. Add garlic and fresh chilli and cook for another few seconds
6. Add celery, carrots and dried herbs and spices. Let the vegetables sweat for a couple of minutes uncovered. Then lower the heat, cover and let cook for 10 minutes
7. Add passata, salt and pepper to taste. Taste and adjust seasonings. You can keep cooking for more time - this will allow the sauce to really come together
8. While the sauce is cooking, cook the spaghetti according to packet instructions. After draining add some olive oil to keep it from sticking
9. Add the tofu in the sauce and let it cook for a few minutes to allow the tofu to absorb the flavours. Add more water if needed.
10. Serve over spaghetti and sprinkle with nutritional yeast
