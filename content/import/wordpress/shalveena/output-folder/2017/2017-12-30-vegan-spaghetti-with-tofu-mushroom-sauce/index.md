A while ago Shalveena and I went to a trip to [beautiful Nelson](https://flipflopsonly.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/fear-less-driving-to-nelson-new-zealand/)Â (New Zealand) with the amazing team of [Prestige Lawyers](https://prestige.law/). One evening I got the chance to cook some pasta which surprisingly turned out quite well. In the following, I will record the recipe as good as I can remember it:
