A while ago Shalveena and I went to a trip to [beautiful Nelson](https://flipflopsonly.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/fear-less-driving-to-nelson-new-zealand/) (New Zealand) with the amazing team of [Prestige Lawyers](https://prestige.law/). One evening I got the chance to cook some pasta which surprisingly turned out quite well. In the following, I will record the recipe as good as I can remember it:

## Ingredients

- 1 packet of [Barilla Whole Grain Spaghetti](https://www.barilla.com/en-us/products/pasta/whole-grain/whole-grain-spaghetti) ([here some more infos on that](http://www.biteofthebest.com/barilla-whole-grain-pasta/))
- 500 g of white button mushrooms, cut into quarters
- 8 cloves of garlic, chopped
- 1 small red onion, chopped
- 3/4 of a bottle of Mutti Passata (which has [no arsenic](https://www.davidpuente.it/blog/2017/11/16/bufala-ritirate-confezioni-della-passata-mutti-ce-arsenico/) in it mind you)
- 1/2 tablespoon of canola oil
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon of pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon of dried parsley
- 3/8 teaspoon of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons of Italian Mixed Herbs (the one [we use](https://www.woolworths.com.au/Shop/ProductDetails/210354/hoyts-italian-herb-mix) is composed of Garlic, Dried Tomato, Basil, Onion, Black Pepper, Oregano, Parsley, Marjoram, Red Bell Pepper and Canola Oil)
- 300 g of hard tofu, scrambled into small bits

## Preparation

1. Heat some oil in a pot or saucepan big enough to hold the mushrooms
2. Add mushrooms and fry on medium to high heat with 1/2 tablespoon of canola oil
3. Continue frying the mushrooms. If water accumulates at the bottom of the pot, take the water out but collect it somewhere. You can start with step 5 while the mushrooms are frying.
4. Once the mushrooms are reduced to 3/4 of their size and nicely fried, switch of the heat.
5. In a separate pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on low heat.
6. Add chopped onion and fry until brown
7. Add Cayenne pepper (optional)
8. Add 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
9. Add chopped garlic and fry until brown
10. Add Cayenne pepper, fry for a few seconds
11. Add 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, reduce heat as much as you can and add Italian Mixed Herbs, let it simmer for about thirty seconds
12. Add Mutti Passata, increase to medium heat
13. Bring to the boil, then let it simmer for 3-5 minutes
14. Add mushrooms and mix everything through
15. Add mushroom water
16. Add scrambled tofu and mix through
17. Add pepper, dried parsley, garlic powder, and salt

Taste it and adjust the ingredients added in 17. to your taste. Cook the pasta in rapidly boiling water until [al dente](https://toscanaslc.com/blog/al-dente-perfect-bite/) and serve together with the sauce.
