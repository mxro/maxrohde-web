title: Ethiopian Christmas Feast
---

Christmas is a time of laughs and talks with full tummies and families sitting around a table. Usually, with lamb roast or other meat of choice. But, it is entirely possible to have a wonderful Christmas feast without meat. This year, we made an Ethiopian themed Christmas dinner. We cooked up _Mesir Wot_ (red lentils cooked in _berbere spice_), _Yekik Alicha_ (yellow split peas cooked), _Azifa_ (green lentil salad), _tikil gomen_ (sauteed carrots, cabbage, and potatoes), Ethiopian style sauteed kale, and Ethiopian green salad.

We had Ethiopian food for the first time here, in Melbourne - there are multiple areas where Ethiopian restaurants line the streets - and it blew us away. We had never tasted something like it before. There weren't any Ethiopian restaurants in Auckland (at least none that we knew of). The dishes tasted a bit like Indian food but not quite. Each dish tasted different and together they made a symphony of tastes. All served on a bed of _injera_ bread, which is a spongy flat bread made of teff flour.  I wanted to recreate it.

And I did! Most of the recipes below are adapted from the [star.com](https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2014/02/21/how_to_make_an_ethiopian_vegetarian_feast.html).
