I am not a designer and as such I was very happy to discover a resource a long time ago that was something along the lines of web design for programmers.The advice in this article that I read so long ago that I don't have the link now was something along the lines of keep your designs simple.Use few different fonts, colors and leave lots of white space.This is advice that I have hence followed in anything that I have designed.

Recently I read the book 'Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness' by Ingrid Fetell Lee and me a whole new perspective on design that I would like to share here.

The book Joyful, Ingrid Lee, goes through various ways in which we can use design to bring more joy into our lives.Unsurprisingly, it turns out that the way to go about this is in complete antithesis to how I have been doing design.

Instead of less colors, use more. Instead of thriving for simplicity, don't be afraid of complexity.
