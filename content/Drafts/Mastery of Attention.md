- Mindfulness is paying attention to the present moment.

- Things we can pay attention to as we go through our day:
	- Press your tongue to the top of your mouth (Source Book Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5779165182)
	- Focus on your breathing, how air enters and leaves your nostrils, how air fills your lungs and belly, how your whole body moves slightly as you breath in and out
	- Do mindful walking, focus on how your feet touch the ground, sounds, wind on your skin, the movement of your limbs
	 - Seek out beauty in nature, people and other creatures
	 - Mindful, slow eating
	 - Paying attention to feelings as they emerge

- Things during meditation session
	- same as day to day but just more focussed and intense, practicing during meditation can help us with practicing these skills as we live our day to day lives
