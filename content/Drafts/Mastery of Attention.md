- Mindfulness is paying attention to the present moment.

- Things we can pay attention to as we go through our day:
	- Press your tongue to the top of your mouth (Source Book Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5779165182)
	- Focus on your breathing, how air enters and leaves your nostrils, how air fills your lungs and belly, how your whole body moves slightly as you breath in and out
	- Do mindful walking, focus on how your feet touch the ground, sounds, wind on your skin, the movement of your limbs
	 - Seek out beauty in nature, people and other creatures
	 - Mindful, slow eating
	 - Paying attention to feelings as they emerge

- Things during meditation session
	- same as day to day but just more focussed and intense, practicing during meditation can help us with practicing these skills as we live our day to day lives
	- body scan: put a flashlight on your body

Be mindful to unleash your inner wellspring of joy

-> breath in, touch top of mouth with the tongue, feel awareness flow through body from head to toes and let it unleash the joy of existence. 

Sharpen the ray of attention to pierce through illusion or widen it to absorb the beauty of existence.

Related to two systems from Thinking Fast and Slow, pierce through: reflective system, widen: automatic system.


But for both of these, don't just see them as shallow, cognitive, link them with Connection, Purpose and Spirit to unleash their full potential.

Helps anchor your in the present.

Insight meditation (Vipassana)

> Then I knew that awareness is how the human being experiences the light of consciousness. I learned the meaning of attention--it is the intentional channeling of awareness. I felt my body again, as a hollow vessel. I looked at my legs; they filled with warm, radiant light, disappearing into brightness. I looked at my arms, with the same result. I focused attention on every part of the body, until I became wholly light once again. Finally, I realized the process of real meditation to expand awareness, to direct attention, to ultimately surrender to the Light of Consciousness.
