I am currently conducting performance conversations with all my direct reports. Unfortunately I am quite busy at the moment, so I do not have that much time to prepare for them. However, I think it is still wortwhile for me to reflect on how to run good performance conversations.

Before I start discussing what a good performance conversation is, I want to briefly go through why we would want to bother with them in the first place: firstly, they are often seen as way for bringing up issues that result in the report not being able to fulfil their responsibilities or behaviour that is harmful to others. However, I find the need for this does not arrive very often and I think when there are any serious issues with a report, a different format and approach than a regular performance conversation is required. In this article, I thus would like to exclude this type of conversation.

In most cases, a performance conversation can be used as a means to highlight a reports contributions and show gratidue for their efforts. It can also be useful as a platform to suggest minor corrections or changes. These must not necessarily be things the report did wrong, instead it could just be changes that help align us to a new strategic direction and evolve our ways of working. Lastly, performance conversations provide a good context to map out a plan for the report that helps them enjoy their work and grow.

Like many things in leadership, performance conversations are difficult to get right. If you are a leader, you may think you are very good at them; but beware - it is difficult for you to know, since there is no easy, objective way to assess your performance. In any case, here are a number of pointers to consider.

## Do your homework and be prepared

Be prepared by gaining a good understanding of the requirements of the role of your report as well as possible avenues of growth and promotion. Familiarise yourself with standardised ways in which performance is assessed in your organisation. Read all relevant documents closely and come prepared with notes.

## List and Discuss Contributions

Prepare a list or have your report prepare a list with all their contributions and successes. Go through each one of these and do not forget to give praise generously.

## Growth Aspirations

Identify growth aspirations with your report. Aim for concrete aspirations that provide clear direction. For instance 'become a better coder' is too unclear. 'Learn rust' is a better aspiration.

Do not confuse aspirations with concrete outcomes unless there is a good reason to. Most interesting aspirations and goals for growth cannot easily be measured. That is why the general aspiration 'Learn rust' is superior to a specific outcome such as 'read 5 books about rust'; the aspiration truly captures the essence of what we are after and not a superficial proxy measurement.

## Changes that make a difference

Indentify if there are any changes in behaviour that can help your report or the team. If there are any, discuss them during the meeting. For instance, if the team has recently not been very engaged in meetings, suggest to each team member to try to contribute more (in addition to this of course also explore other cultural issues that could be the cause).

## Speak Their Language

Each person is different and comprehends things in their own way. It is your responsibility as a leader to aim to frame things in a way that makes your message easier to understand for your report.

## Close with Gratitude

Do not forget to close the meeting with expressing your gratitude for your reports contribution. They have spent countless hours working for the team, and without the contributions of your reports, the impact of your team would be minimal.

## Seek Feedback

Be mindful of the things you may do wrong during the conversation and seek feedback from your reports to help you improve.

Many leaders dread during performance reviews and I must confess that at times I have fallen into this group. Unfortunately, modern work is a busy place and putting in the time to have long and deep conversations is something that often puts strain on leaders when there are other committments. It is important for organisations and leaders of leaders to make it easy for their leaders to succeed by giving them the breathing space perform performance conversations regularily.

Unfortunately many leaders today that succeed in doing amazing performance reviews do so despite the environment provided to them not because of it. There is always plenty of talk from HR departements about how important these are, and plenty of brochures and slide decks to go through. But no one thinks of giving leaders the one thing they need to be successful: time.

If you are a leader and feel you are not doing well enough for your reports, be forgiving with yourselves and take into account the difficulties the environment creates for you. Try to be a little bit better, and be assured that every little bit better counts for your reports - and as always, lead with humanity.
