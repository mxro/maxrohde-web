The complex world that makes up our inner self is difficult to describe in scientifically accurate terms. Julian Baggini argues in the excellent book [The Ego Trick](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4197386158) that it is certain that our self is not one coherent persona, but instead that it changes over time and depending on the situations we find ourselves in. Moreover, our selves are composed of different parts that are difficult to define.

Freudian psychology is based on the model that our mind may be comprised of the agents of id, ego and super-ego. Where the id represents our base animal concerns and desires, ego represents our consciousness and super-ego the higher values and cultural norms we have adopted. This model, also known as the structural model, has proven useful for many discussions about ourselves. However, I would not call it scientific. Rather, it is one model of many we might create for our minds and not the true and only model.

The usual approach in science to assess the validity of a model is to run experiments. I am not aware of any experiments that have validated the structural model (see [Review: Experimental Evidence and Psychotherapy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/687864), but I am no expert in the field and so happy to be corrected). I suspect that exploring something as abstract as the organisation of our minds experimentally may be beyond our means for quite a while.

In situations where one aspect of reality may be described with different models, and we are unable to assess these models using scientific methods, I believe it is a good approach to evaluate these models by exploring how useful they are. I assume the structural model was created under the umbrella of understanding imbalances in the mind better and heal those affected by it. As such, this model may be useful in helping those afflicted by serious psychological conditions, but may be of less use for application to our everyday problems.

In this article, I will describe a different model of the mind. I found this in the book [Positive Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13221308-positive-intelligence) by Shirzad Chamine. The model described by Chamine helps us understand our inner world by identifying perspectives within ourselves and labelling these as distinct personas. Some of these help us be more happy and successful, while others just help us be more miserable. Chamine calls the latter personas _saboteurs_ and the persona helping us the _sage_.

In the following, I first describe the saboteurs, then the sage and finally provide a discussion of this model overall.

## Saboteurs

### The Judge

The Judge in us excels as finding the faults in people, situations, and everything else in the world. We are quick to find why other people are not good enough, implicitly establishing that we are better. That notwithstanding, the chief object of the Judge is ourselves and encourages us to ponder endlessly the many ways in which we are lacking.

### The Stickler

The Stickler in us will drives us to make things more perfect than they need to be and bring us dissatisfaction if anything is not perfect. Worse yet, if we leave our inner Sticklers free rein, we affect the lives of those around us by drawing them into our circle of dissatisfaction and anxiety.

### The Pleaser

The Pleaser in us will not be satisfied until all the needs of those we love are satisfied first. This encourages others to take advantage of our commitment and eventually we will be burnt out from all the helping especially since we won't allow any time to look after our own needs.

### The Hyper-Achiever

The Hyper-Achiever in us will drive us to be first and best in everything. This is certainly the way to kick start many a great career but is more often than not unsustainable and often joyless.

### The Victim

The Victim in us quickly identifies the many things in the world and the many things people do that are unfair, specifically unfair to us. This drives great unsatisfaction and makes it difficult to live with us since there will always be plenty of opportunities for us to feel short-changed.

### The Hyper-Rational

When we are being hyper-rational, we focus too much on logic and truth above human connection and emotion. Sometimes the illogical thing can be the right thing to do, if it helps those around us.

### The Hyper-Vigilant

When we are being hyper-vigilant, we overemphasise potential problems and danger, possibly biasing us to miss out on opportunities and enjoying life.

### The Restless

When we are being restless, we are constantly searching for the next thing to excite us. What we have in the here and there never seems enough and we seek increasinly extreme ways to entertain us.

### The Controller

The Controller in us delights in micromanaging others and all aspects of the world around us. Furthermore, the Controller needs to be in charge and finds it very difficult to follow the lead of others.

### The Avoider

The Avoider in us seeks that which is stress-free and pleasurable and avoids doing inconvenient, stressful and uncomfortable things, even if these need to be done.

I think it is beyond doubt that each of us adopts the perspective of each of the above personas sometimes. What shapes our character is to what extend we usually adopt these. I believe there are few things in the world of the mind that are perfectly good or bad; for that it is far to intricate. Thus I do not think all these listed saboteurs are inherently evil. Rather, we need to accept that they are a part of us. Key though is to be mindful to what degree we adopt these personas and be ready to gently change our ways when their influence harms ourselves and others.

## The Sage

Apart from the saboteur personas listed above, Chamine also proposes a persona that helps us be more wholesome and happy: the Sage persona. Unfortunately, we get ten personas to sabotage our own happiness but only one persona that helps us be better. This persona, the Sage, though is described has having five powers we can employ to our advantage:

### Emphatise

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. The empathy Chamie describes under this sage power though goes beyond the dictionary definition. Firstly it includes empathy towards ourselves which I think can best be understood as understanding ourselves better. Further, empathy here includes forgiveness. To me, forgiveness does not equal empathy necessarily but it is certainly helpful to emphatise to make it easier for us to forgive. However, I do believe that forgivness here is the real _super_power, it being the wellspring of consolation and strength it often is.

So, in short, the power to emphatise involves understanding others and ourselves better and accepting and forgiving anything we find lacking.

### Explore

Explore is the ability to seek out something new not with fear but with curiosity and wonder. Key here I think is the absence of fear. As we grow older, we tend to learn to fear rather than learn to learn; chiefly in credit to our institutionalised education. We need to relearn to explore the new without this baggage and instead explore it with childlike wonder. However, we also need to explore with an open mind, accepting not only what suits us but everything we perceive.

### Innovate

The power to Innovate describes our ability to find novel solutions to problems or in other words to be creative. Similarily to exploring, this requires us to have an open mind and be accepting of possibilities we generally would not consider. Chamie distinguishes Explore and Innovate by the former being about learning about what is and the former being about creating something new.

### Navigate

The power to Navigate aids choose the right paths if multiple options are available to us.

We adopt one or more of these perspectives based on our personality and the situation we find ourselves in. Saboteurs are perspectives which generally
