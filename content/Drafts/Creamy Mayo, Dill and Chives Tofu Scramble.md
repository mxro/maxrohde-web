I made this tofu scramble today and was blown away by how delicious it was. If I got this at a cafe, I'd want to go back there to get it again and again. 

The tofu was creamy, taste and just hit the spot. It's a twist on [my original tofu recipe](https://shalveena.com/2020/11/02/easy-tofu-scramble), which was inspired by mum's Indian style scrambled eggs. This new recipe is more like a traditional Western scrambled egg, with chives and dill giving it that extra yumminess. 

## Ingredients
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 500g firm or extra firm tofu, crumbled
- 1/2 small onion chopped
- fresh dill and chives, chopped
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 2 Tbsp vegan mayonaise
- 1/2 cup soy milk
- 1 tsp dijon mustard
- 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast flakes

## Method
1. Heat olive oil in a non stick frying pan over low to medium heat. Once the oil is warm, add the onions and cook until the onions soften. 
2. Add 1/2 tsp of turmeric, mix well and then add the crumbled tofu, salt and pepper to taste. I used about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp of salt. Mix and fry to tofu for a couple of minutes. 
3. While the tofu is frying, get a small bowl and mix together the following: 
	- the remaining 1/2 tsp of turmeric 
	- smoked paprika
	- paprika
	- garlic powder
	- onion powder
4. Add the above to the tofu, mix and let it cook so the tofu can absorb the tastes. Continue cooking until the tofu starts to sort of seal and brown a bit - around 5 minutes.
5. Add the chopped dill and chives and mix.
6. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonaise, soy milk and mustard. Add it to the pan along with the nutritional yeast. Mix well and cook until desired consistency is reached.
7. Enjoy!
