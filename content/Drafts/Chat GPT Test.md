Write me a paragraph about how to use Chat GPT in Obsidian.

To use Chat GPT in Obsidian, you first need to install the relevant plugin. Once installed, you can create a new note and type in your prompt. For example, if you want to have a conversation with the AI about your favorite book, you can type in "What is your favorite book?" and hit enter. The plugin will then use GPT-3 to generate a response based on your prompt. You can continue the conversation by typing in follow-up questions or statements and waiting for the AI's response. The Chat GPT plugin can be a useful tool for brainstorming, generating ideas, or simply having fun conversations with an AI. However, it's important to remember that the responses generated by the AI may not always be accurate or appropriate, so use your own judgment when assessing its output.
