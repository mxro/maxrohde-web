- I have been thinking about updating my framework ['for the mastery of live'](https://maxrohde.com/2023/08/13/framework-life-mastery-v01)
- I have been considering to change the mastery of thought with something else specifically, the mastery of attention.  
- This is due to me thinking that thought is something very general and provides little guidance as exactly what is asked of here. And likewise, I was struggling to find a good description for that and good actionable directions of how to attain mastery for this particular area.  
- Then when I was reading the book The Way of the Peaceful Worrier by Dan Millman, I came across a section that very much was focused on the benefits of attention. The section will be provided below. 

Then I knew that awareness is how the human being experiences the light of consciousness. I learned the meaning of attention--it is the intentional channeling of awareness. I felt my body again, as a hollow vessel. I looked at my legs; they filled with warm, radiant light, disappearing into brightness. I looked at my arms, with the same result. I focused attention on every part of the body, until I became wholly light once again. Finally, I realized the process of real meditation to expand awareness, to direct attention, to ultimately surrender to the Light of Consciousness.

- Doing some research I found that attention was something quite central to a Buddhist philosophy as well. Specifically there is a story of a Zen student who goes to his master and asks him what is the central teaching of Buddhism and the master replies attention to which the student raises to attention and subsequently asks what but teacher tell me I ask you what does this trend to a teaching of Buddhism and the master then replies attention attention attention

Attention is also quite central to a lot of meditation practices, with many of them starting by asking one to pay attention to one's breath.

However, as I was starting to do more research about it, I became more and more confused specifically about the question what exactly attention is and how it relates to meditation practices and mindfulness.

A question I want to explore in this article.

## Attention

Attention is something that we can consciously control. We can make ourselves focus our attention on particular sense impressions or objects.Attention is like a spotlight that we can shine on something.I like to think of attention as being very rooted in the so-called system two of Kahneman's thinking fast and slow.Here are some adjectives that Kahneman uses to describe this system of thinking: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious.

Thus, our attention is very much under our control, but it is also very limited in that the spotlight captured by our attention only covers a very small area.


## Awareness

Awareness by contrast can be quite far-reaching.We can be aware of many things and also I believe we can be aware of things both consciously and subconsciously.Thus, I like to link awareness to what Kahneman describes as System 1.This system is described with the following adjectives: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious.

Thus, our awareness is far more powerful than our attention and can capture a much wider scope. However, our control over our awareness is also far more limited than the control we can have over our attention.

## Mindfulness

Mindfulness is a term often employed, but I believe often also poorly understood.The poor understanding of it is, I think, rooted in the inherent complexity in this concept.Tension and awareness are not so easy to wrap one's head around and I believe that mindfulness can be best explained as a combination and interplay of these two concepts.

Mindfulness meditation can be described in two phases. In the first phase, we really focus our attention on something very particular, such as our breath or a particular mantra.And then in the second phase, we more focus on a general awareness of any introspective thoughts or external sense impressions.

Thus, I like to understand mindfulness as the mastery over both the system one and system two of Kahneman's framework, as well as the control of the interplay between these two.

And I also believe then the true mastery we're looking for here is not specifically the mastery of attention, nor the mastery of awareness, but really the mastery of both of these and to employ both of them masterfully, but also be able to switch between them and combine them as required.

In conclusion, I have yet to define whether I want to update my framework and how I want to update it. On the one hand, attention is something that's way more concrete than thinking. But also, thinking kind of helps us capture this mastery that's required over these two systems of thinking as defined by Kahneman.

- Mindfulness is paying attention to the present moment.

- Things we can pay attention to as we go through our day:
	- Press your tongue to the top of your mouth (Source Book Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5779165182)
	- Focus on your breathing, how air enters and leaves your nostrils, how air fills your lungs and belly, how your whole body moves slightly as you breath in and out
	- Do mindful walking, focus on how your feet touch the ground, sounds, wind on your skin, the movement of your limbs
	 - Seek out beauty in nature, people and other creatures
	 - Mindful, slow eating
	 - Paying attention to feelings as they emerge

- Things during meditation session
	- same as day to day but just more focussed and intense, practicing during meditation can help us with practicing these skills as we live our day to day lives
	- body scan: put a flashlight on your body

Be mindful to unleash your inner wellspring of joy

-> breath in, touch top of mouth with the tongue, feel awareness flow through body from head to toes and let it unleash the joy of existence. 

Sharpen the ray of attention to pierce through illusion or widen it to absorb the beauty of existence.

Related to two systems from Thinking Fast and Slow, pierce through: reflective system, widen: automatic system.


But for both of these, don't just see them as shallow, cognitive, link them with Connection, Purpose and Spirit to unleash their full potential.

Helps anchor your in the present.
