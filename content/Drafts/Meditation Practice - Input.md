I've recently been looking at the interplay between attention, awareness and mindfulness.Meditation is very closely linked to those because it is about mastering our attention but also ultimately about attaining better mindfulness.

A lot of the information out there about meditation provides us a clear picture of the benefits of meditations, such as being able to increase our mindfulness, but also to manage our stress levels.There is also no shortage of instructions of how to go about meditation.What I believe is lacking, though, is the connection between the outcomes that meditation aims to help us achieve and the concrete practices that are proposed.I'm not saying that these practices are not effective. However, in the way that my mind works, I always want to understand end-to-end how doing a certain aspect of a practice will help us achieve the relevant goals.

I do believe that the better understanding of attention, awareness and mindfulness can actually help us unpack how meditation works and help guide us to do so effectively.

Chiefly, in my previous article, I talked about how actually to be a master of our attention, we cannot just look at attention, but we need to look at attention and awareness together, with both of them to some degree helping us master our thinking.

Specifically, in the sense of that we can think in two different ways. One way, which is very rational and pointed. And another way, which is more intuitive and holistic.And to unleash the whole capacity of our mind, we need to be able to engage in both of these ways and bridge them effectively.That is, I think, which ultimately enables us to reach mindfulness.For more information on these two ways of thinking, also see the book by Kahneman, Thinking Fast and Slow.

I believe meditation has been such a successful practice because it actually helps us in understanding and mastering these two ways of thinking better.In meditation practice we are often asked to focus our mind on a specific thing, such as our breath or particular sense impressions. That links to the rational and pointed way of thinking.

However, eventually we are asked to broaden our awareness of any thoughts or impressions that may come our mind and rather than to pointedly investigate them, to notice them and then discard them.

there are different ways to do meditation but i do think that this is one of the most popular ones and based directly on vipassana meditation and a millenia-old practice. Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices. The method comes directly from the [Satipatthana Sutta [Foundations of Mindfulness]](https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/satipatthana-sutta-mindfulness/), a discourse attributed to the [Buddha](https://tricycle.org/beginners/buddhism/who-was-the-buddha/) himself.

Based on this, I developed the following meditation practice for myself I'm currently trying out.I call this practice the shepherding of awareness.Since, as said, as we may be able to direct our attention directly and very pointedly, our awareness is at least partially subconscious and far more difficult for us to direct.But I think to achieve true mastery in our thinking, it's not so much about being able to control our attention, which we all can do naturally, but it is about controlling our awareness, which links directly to the intuitive and holistic way of thinking, which has been found to be overall far more powerful than the directed and rational way we can focus.

Anyway, without further ado, let me propose a practice below.

## Step 1: Get Ready

First find a comfortable position. This can be sitting, lying down, standing or anything in between that works for you. Next, close your eyes.

Note, please don't overthink it, how you sit or lie or where you sit or lie, whether it is a completely silent or a more loud environment.

## Step 2 Breath

Then start concentrating on your breath, really focus the spotlight of your attention on your breath. It can be helpful at the beginning of the practice to purposely do some deep and careful breaths through the belly to really anchor ourselves in a peaceful and healthy way of breathing. 

## Step 3 Sense Doors

After a few breaths, maybe 10 or so, start a survey of what the Buddhists call the six sense doors of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking about/mind. The door of [mind](http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Mind "Mind") refers to our [thoughts](http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Thoughts "Thoughts"), [emotions](http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Emotions "Emotions"), and [mental](http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Mental "Mental") images.

Simply note what you are perceiving through each one of them. And yes, the seeing one should just delight you with a rather black view since you have closed your eyes. 

For a more detailed view on the six sense doors, see this video: https://www.robphillipsyoga.com/blog/2020/7/27/noting-the-six-sense-doors-simple-vipassana-for-beginners-15-minute-mahasi-style-guided-meditation

Since, to remember six different things is something which at least challenges my memory, I would recommend to define yourself a specific order how you want to go through each of these six sense doors, such as starting with seeing, then moving on to hearing, and so further and so on.

## Step 4 Body Scan

Next, really focus on your body and what you feel inside, especially aches and pain or tension. direct your attention to any place in your body where you feel pain or tension or anything else uncomfortable.

## Step 5 Connection

As per my proposed life mastery framework, to feel a connection to our environment, other people and the greater scheme of the world is very important for our overall well-being.

How the step works best for you, I think really depends on your preferences and also your spiritual understanding. It could here for instance also mean for you the connection to God or the whole of the world together. Below just a few suggestions what you could be focusing on.

Following up from the fourth step of body, I would recommend that you first focus on feeling the pull of gravity that pulls your body down to the earth. You are only feeling the effect of gravity because of the uncountable atoms that make up the earth and thus you feeling the gravity connects you with everything the earth is.

Next, put your mind to how your inhaling and exhaling makes you exchange particles with the atmosphere.And since there is no clear division between the particles, this really puts you in touch with the whole of the sky.

## Step 6 Spirit

My life mastery framework also includes a mastery of spirit. Nourishing our connection to what cannot be touched, seen, heard and fully understood.

Dwelling into this realm, I believe, is really the highest state of meditation that we can achieve.But I don't think we should set this as a goal for ourselves to achieve at every meditation session. Maybe some people can, but maybe some people will never reach this realm.So, I would say overall it is something that is valuable but not essential.

## Why these Steps

As I mentioned before, I wanted to come up with a more effective form of meditation practice by building on the connection between attention, awareness and mindfulness.And to do so under the theme of shepherding our awareness. And that is exactly what the previous steps are designed for.We start with what is most simple, by focusing our attention on something that is simple and straightforward, specifically our breath.We then focus our attention on the sense doors and we do so with a very specific purpose and that is to anchor ourselves in the here and now.our senses are in the here and now, even those impressions related to our thoughts or the mind, they may be about something that is in the future or the past, but in this practice we really want to focus on that we are thinking them right now.

Ultimately, the purpose of this is to shepherd our awareness to the here and now.

The next step of doing a body scan has the same purpose, because like our senses, our bodies exist in the here and now, and the more we bring our awareness to that, in a more peaceful state of mind we find ourselves.

The last two steps to focus on connection and spirit, that is really about allowing us to unleash the power of our awareness. It is very difficult to think about our connection to the environment, the earth, other people and the universe as a whole. We can think about it, but where really the power of this lies is to feel it and to understand it to some degree. And I really think that can only be achieved by our awareness as opposed to by directing our attention.

If we are successful in this, that is focusing our awareness on the here and now and helping our attention grasp the beauty and vastness of the universe, then I think this practice of meditation can become a wellspring of joy and energy that we can use to make our lives better.

## Conclusion

As many posts on this blog, these are really just my work-in-progress considerations.I do feel that there is a high chance that I would change these eventually.As a matter of fact, you can find many practices on this blog, some of which are similar and some of which are different to what I have proposed here.

For now, I hope this can be helpful to someone and I would be very happy to hear some comments, feedbacks, or questions.
