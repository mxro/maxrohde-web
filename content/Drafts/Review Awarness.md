## Introduction

1. I don't really use any social networks or social media websites, with the exception of one, YouTube.
2. YouTube is perfect for me since it provides a willing canvas for my eclectic interests that change rapidly month to month, and YouTube's recommendation algorithm is quite apt at picking these up and recommending me videos to indulge my interests.
3. In December last year, the interest I was able to pick up was in late 20th-century philosophers with an Eastern bend, or so to say, those that bridge the West and the East. How I originally came to it is, I guess, by viewing something from Fid Nacht Han and YouTube figuring out the rest.
4. Among those was Alan Watts, who I think is quite well known, but I also got some recommendations from a little bit unexpected angle of a Jesuit priest called Anthony DeMello, for which a few lectures in very questionable video and audio quality are available on YouTube.
5. I was at once blown away by his unique style, a sense of thinking, and ideas. Thus, I was quick to have a look around if there would be any books available by him. Which there are technically, but in a way, Awareness and many of his other books are not books in the traditional sense, how we usually find them. But they are chiefly collections of other things, such as small stories in The Prayer of the Frog, but also slightly edited transcripts of his lectures.
6. The book Awareness falls into the second category. And originally reading it feels a bit strange because it is obviously a transcription of spoken text of a lecture, which doesn't usually come along as smooth as prose written specifically for a book. However, I think that many of the ideas contained within this book make it more than worthwhile to deal with this little bit unusual style.

## Key Ideas

### Presence in the Moment

The book is really quite aptly named with the title Awareness, because that relates back to the essential thesis of the book, that by being aware in the present moment, by connecting with the wonder of creation, we are able to connect with the divine and find happiness in our lives. He also refers to this as 'waking up'. 

### Illusion of the I

Many other parts of the book are more about what not to know or what not to do. So, for instance, to reach the state of awareness, de Mello argues that we need to strip away at the I, what we define as I. He thinks it's far too expansive. It's things that we just imagine we are and that are important to what we are, but that a matter of fact aren't, but instead are just what he calls illusions. So, for instance, if you happen to be a doctor and then you define yourself as I am a doctor, then he would call this a harmful illusion. Since you may at some point not be able to be a doctor anymore because of health or because of something else, and then you will slide into unhappiness. But he would say you slide into unhappiness for no reason whatsoever. You have just fallen trap to this illusion by defining yourself as something that is actually not the essence of you. But if you define your I, you strip it down to its core elementals, then he says nothing can really harm you, nothing can make you unhappy but yourself and your perspective on yourself.

>If you’re lucky and the gods are gracious or if you are gifted with divine grace (use any theological expression you want), you might suddenly understand who “I” is, and you’ll never be the same again, never. Nothing will ever be able to touch you again and no one will ever be able to hurt you again. You will fear no one and you will fear nothing.

### Attachment and Desire

he also puts a lot of emphasis that what stands in our way to reach deep happiness and contentment are our desires and he challenges the audience towards the beginning of the book that he will give them a way to find this deep happiness or contentment but that he knows that most of them will not be able to want to take that up eventually because it would mean to give up on all your desires and attachments and oftentimes we think of desires as we can easily give that up because maybe that's my desire for eating sweets or having a drink at night but in the back of our minds we distinguish between good and bad desires where bad desires yeah of course we season them with something that we don't want but we have also plenty of desires that we consider good but then he questions why do we consider them good and generally that's so because of societal pressures so let's give an example of that so let's say you would be a student you're pursuing a degree and now his challenge would be would you be willing to give up your degree for your happiness and essentially that is at the root of this question of desire because when you have this desire to have a degree so you can get a stable job so you can buy a house and whatever all these things there are desires and as long as we carry those with us we are bound to be unhappy

Similar things he says about love. He says you cannot really love somebody truly if you desire them for yourself, even if you just desire their company, or even if you just desire their good health, because he would then argue that by having these desires linked to them, you set yourself up for suffering and unhappiness for when they are unwell, or then you will feel bad, or if they leave you, then you feel bad, and that is in your way of really truly loving them. 

>It’s been there all along, staring us in the face in the scriptures, though we never cared to see it because we were so drowned in what our culture calls love with its love songs and poems—that isn’t love at all, that’s the opposite of love. That’s desire and control and possessiveness. That’s manipulation, and fear, and anxiety—that’s not love.

So that is something else, I think, that makes this challenge true, what he said in the beginning, that he thinks most people are not wanting to comply with that, because now we have a choice. Do we want to keep our desire, or do we want to get to this nirvana of happiness? And I think most of us, we would probably say the ones that we love, of course we want to continue to love them, we want to continue to care about their well-being, and we don't mind to be affected when they are feeling bad, to maintain that relationship that we have. But he then rightly says, if you do that, if you have that decision, then you set yourself up for suffering in your life and won't be able to follow his recipe of achieving contentment and happiness through this awareness.

> I was saying that we don’t want to be happy. We want other things. Or let’s put it more accurately: We don’t want to be unconditionally happy. I’m ready to be happy provided I have this and that and the other thing.

### Religion

Another interesting aspect of his lecture is religion. Being a Jesuit monk who are Catholics, I would have expected a lot more reference to the teachings of the Bible, but I think he mostly assumes that he's teaching to an audience who's already very familiar with that. But in any case it seems like that he has more of a view of a unified religion, that different religions around the world are based on some fundamental truths which are then reflected in what he teaches. So he speaks of the mystics and the sages of which he considers Jesus to be one, but also the Buddha and other eastern philosophers. No wonder then that posthumously he got into trouble with Cardinal Ratzinger, who would later go on to become Pope, who discredited some of his writings and henceforth some of these will need to be accompanied by a warning label in Catholic bookshops. But at least they're still being sold.

### Self Observation

Being a psychologist, there is also quite a bit of content on how to better understand ourselves, our emotions. So de Mello recommends that we should observe ourselves with great curiosity and thereby understand our emotions and feelings, becoming aware of them, but then also understand how, also trying through this observation, understand what are the illusions that harm us.

> How are you going to understand what you disapprove of, or what you approve of, for that matter? All of this sounds like a new world, doesn’t it? No judgment, no commentary, no attitude: one simply observes, one studies, one watches, without the desire to change what is. Because if you desire to change what is into what you think should be, you no longer understand.

### 'Treating' Depression

This approach also gives us consolation when we are feeling bad, by being to disentangle ourselves from the emotions we experience:

> You say, “I’m depressed.” But that is false. You are not depressed. If you want to be accurate, you might say, “I am experiencing a depression right now.”

Here to sum up his suggested approach to reliaving us from suffering. 

> Put this program into action, a thousand times: (a) identify the negative feelings in you; (b) understand that they are in you, not in the world, not in external reality; (c) do not see them as an essential part of “I”; these things come and go; (d) understand that when you change, everything changes.

This also includes the element of change. He earlier argues that we should desire nothing, be attached to nothing - so we ask ourselves - shouldn't we be going out and doing good in the world. to that de Mello responsd,, without understanding, we shouldn't be doing anything, since we may do more harm than good, and also, once there is understanding, change will naturally come.

>When there’s something within you that moves in the right direction, it creates its own discipline.

### Change

de Mello also emphasises that often when we do 'selfless acts' we do those for selfish reasons - e.g. to wanting to be seen as virtuous by others. He also cautions that often when we think we are making things better, we may actually be making them worse. Thus, he suggests, we should focus on understanding, ourselves first but also others. Then he also says we shouldn't want to institute change, neither in ourselves or others, but instead focus on understanding yourself and others, from which he says change will spring forth without having to be forced.

>Now, the danger of attempting to change others or change things when you yourself are not aware is that you may be changing things for your own convenience, your pride, your dogmatic convictions and beliefs, or just to relieve your negative feelings.
