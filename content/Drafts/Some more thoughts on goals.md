Nishkama Karma, self-less or desireless action, is an action performed without any expectation of fruits or results, and the central tenet of Karma Yoga path to liberation.

> You’ve got to make sure of your “being” before you swing into action.

> To practice aimlessness doesn’t mean that we don’t have a dream or aspiration. It means to stay in touch with the ultimate dimension in the present moment, so we can realize our dreams with joy, ease, and freedom.

Thich Nhat Hanh


> Aimlessness does not mean doing nothing. It means not putting something in front of you to chase after. When we remove the objects of our craving and desires, we discover that happiness and freedom are available to us right here in the present moment.

Thich Nhat Hanh

> “Our plans miscarry because they have no aim. When a man does not know what harbor he is making for, no wind is the right wind.”

— Seneca

Anyone noticed a change in the targeted advertising courteously delivered to us at every opportunity to our tiny screens? Got a few more recommendations for weight loss programs, exercise programs, gym memberships or donations?

I certainly did and not by accident! Since any self respecting marketing manager for the industries involved in helping us be more virtuous or just altogether a better me, will ensure the bulk of their budget is spend in the fortuitous months of December and January: New Year's resolution time!

I happily join this chorus with my very own article on goal setting - which may actually arrive to you in January - but also possibly later, since my writing sometimes takes its sweet time.

Last year's instalment on the same topic arrived in March, where I suggested [A Practical Guide to Define a Personal Purpose](https://maxrohde.com/2023/03/15/defining-a-personal-purpose-a-practical-guide) - but don't go and read that - since hence I have completely changed my mind on the matter, so it will only add to the confusion this article you are reading presently may already cause on its own.

Hold on tight, since this year's goal setting article has a rather scandalous message: **Don't set goals**!

## Why: Desire and Aimlessness

I have spent a fair amount of time in the past years reading what I would call 'pop' Buddhism literature, and though they are certainly simplistic, I do think they managed to get the core message across to my simple mind: there is suffering (such as anxiety, fear, depression, pain, illness, and, the big one, death), suffering is caused by desire, letting go of desire is the way to contain suffering, and there are specific steps open to everyone to achieve just that.

I think there is enormous wisdom in this. Just think of love: love creates the strongest desires, and it can also causes the greatest pain; when our love is unrequited or our loved one's die.

Given these fundamental insights, we should pause before setting any goals. Why? Goals, in essence, are just formalised desires. And, since more desires equal more suffering, we should be wary of creating goals.

Now, if anyone questions that goals can cause suffering, you probably haven't set yourself many goals. Let's go with a classic; the January gym membership. It first gives us a jolt of satisfaction as we sign the contract, but then quickly unleashes an epic struggle between our best intentions and life's realities, usually resulting in an abundance of guilt and self-loathing. Not to talk of the suffering we intermittently have to endure in the gym in the few times we do end up going!

In contrast, the opposite of setting goals, aimlessness, in Buddhism is known as the [Third Door of Liberation](https://awaken.com/2021/10/what-are-the-three-doors-of-liberation/) - which definitely has a nice sound to it. To explore the merits of non-goal setting or aimlessness, one can try this simple exercise suggested by late Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh:

>Try practicing aimlessness for just five minutes, and you will see how happy you are during those five minutes.

## Success

Let's start with the idea of success. Climber and philosopher Francis Sanzaro relates the following story in the article [Moment to Moment](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/17/opinion/sports-zen-mental-subtraction.html):

> A few years ago, I stood underneath a red overhanging cliff near my hometown, Carbondale, Colo. [...] I was attempting to do a route first try, “onsight,” as we call it, which means I didn’t know what I was climbing into. It would have been a hard onsight for me — to onsight hard climbs, you need clarity. No interference.
> Just as I was about to climb, nerves in my body, which I hadn’t felt yet, said hello. That’s not good for any athlete.
> Desperate, [...] I visualized myself at the top, celebrating.
> It didn’t work. I fell near the top. Defeated, I lowered to the ground and realized [...] that the desire to climb the route had kept me from doing it.
> [...]
> On a whim, I told myself that on my next attempt, success or failure was irrelevant. “Make one move at a time. That’s all.” I gave myself a pass from whatever would transpire. Case closed.
> It worked. I floated to the top with poise, clarity and bewilderment.

Not an entirely new idea, as recounted in the following story provided by Anthony de Mello in [Awareness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94318.Awareness):

>There’s a lovely saying of Tranxu, a great Chinese sage [...]. It goes: “When the archer shoots for no particular prize, he has all his skills; when he shoots to win a brass buckle, he is already nervous; when he shoots for a gold prize, he goes blind, sees two targets, and is out of his mind. His skill has not changed, but the prize divides him. He cares! He thinks more of winning than of shooting, and the need to win drains him of power.”

What both of these source suggest is that the more powerful our desire for achieving our goals, the more it hinders our potential. I don't think I agree 100%, but if being successful is important to you, this is a perspective worth considering.

## Direction

As for being rudderless, not being able to live our purpose and make an impact - what's the alternative? Do you really know where you are going, what good you will do and does it make you happy? I have written quite a few articles on [finding](https://maxrohde.com/2020/05/23/finding-purpose) and [defining](https://maxrohde.com/2023/03/15/defining-a-personal-purpose-a-practical-guide) a purpose and have been tinkering with this for a long time - mostly unsuccessfully, I have to admit.

Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh again has some thoughts on this for us:

>To practice aimlessness is to identify what it is you’re looking for, waiting for, or running after, and let it go. By removing these objects of seeking that are pulling you away from the here and now, you will discover that everything you want is already right here in the present moment. You don’t need to “be someone” or do something in order to be happy and free.

Lastly, isn't not setting goals a goal in itself? That's a tricky one, and indeed I think we can easily do some mental gymnastics to show that, "well, we do have goals after all, just better ones", to placate anyone who really doesn't want to let go of goals.

There is a bit of a paradox here for sure, and one that I don't think can be fully resolved. 

The best way to look at it is I think to separate goals from [intentions](https://dharmawisdom.org/the-hearts-intention/) and preferences.

Intentions - in the sense of Right Intentions from Buddhist teachings, not the dictionary definition of intentions - are different from goals in that they are not directed at future outcomes but rather at how we want to be in the here and now. 'Being aimless' would be an example for an intention.

Preferences are an expression of our personal likes and dislikes. Formalised, they can also act as a guide to provide us with direction. Again, we could say we _prefer_ to be aimless rather than to pursue goals. However, in contrast to goals, achieving these preferences is not linked to personal satisfaction.

## Action

The key in all this is to combat the key evil identified in the Buddhist teachings: desire. However, while desire is undoubtedly a driver for action, having no desire, doesn't mean to act. Indeed, this is a key theme of the ancient Hindu text _The Bhagavadgita_ - how to act without desire:

> _To action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive; neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction_.

— Verse 47, Chapter 2



If you find yourself agreeing with me at this point, you probably haven't thought this through. 

After all, without setting goals, how can we ever be _successful_?

Without setting goals, aren't we wasting our lives by drifting rudderless through existence?

Plus, isn't not setting goals not a goal in itself?

We don't just arbitrarily set goals. We set goals, since doing so is deeply embedded in our culture, and our culture is deeply embedded in us. And, thus, the idea of not setting goals, should at least be mildly offensive.

Let's turn to some more ancient wisdom to unravel


-   
    -Samkhya theory and Yoga practise, _The Bhagavadgita_[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishkama_Karma#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishkama_Karma#cite_note-20)


Take instead whose teachings have been, delightfully, labelled 'dangerous' by the Catholic church a few years after his death.



As a norther German, I should know, since I grew up near what can be described as the medieval epicentre of the movement that leads to today's self-improvement craze: the reformation and the resulting [protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism). 

The idea in the west for centuries has been that the gift of God's salvation should be repaid through hard work.
