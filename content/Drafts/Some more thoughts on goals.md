Anyone noticed a change in the targeted advertising courteously delivered to us at every opportunity to our tiny screens? Got a few more recommendations for weight loss programs, exercise programs, gym memberships or donations?

I certainly did and not by accident! Since any self respecting marketing manager for the industries involved in helping us be more virtuous or just altogether a better me, will ensure the bulk of their budget is spend in the fortuitous months of December and January: New Year's resolution time!

I happily join this chorus with my very own article on goal setting - which may actually arrive to you in January - but also possibly later, since my writing sometimes takes its sweet time.

Last year's instalment on the same topic arrived in March, where I suggested [A Practical Guide to Define a Personal Purpose](https://maxrohde.com/2023/03/15/defining-a-personal-purpose-a-practical-guide) - but don't go and read that - since hence I have completely changed my mind on the matter, so it will only add to the confusion this article you are reading presently may already cause on its own.

Hold on tight, since this year's goal setting article has a rather scandalous message: **Don't set goals**!

. . .

Let me explain.

I have spent a fair amount of time in the past years reading what I would call 'pop' Buddhism literature, and though they are certainly simplistic, I do think they managed to get the core message across to my simple mind: there is suffering (such as anxiety, fear, depression, pain, illness, and, the big one, death), suffering is caused by desire, letting go of desire is the way to contain suffering, and there are specific steps open to everyone to achieve just that.

I think there is enormous wisdom in this. Just think of love: love creates the strongest desires, and it can also causes the greatest pain; when our love is unrequited or our loved one's die.

Given these fundamental insights, we should pause before setting any goals. Why? Goals, in essence, are just formalised desires. And, since more desires equal more suffering, we should be wary of creating goals.

Now, if anyone questions that goals can cause suffering, you probably haven't set yourself many goals. Let's go with a classic; the January gym membership. It first gives us a jolt of satisfaction as we sign the contract, but then quickly unleashes an epic struggle between our best intentions and life's realities, usually resulting in an abundance of guilt and self-loathing. Not to talk of the suffering we intermittently have to endure in the gym in the few times we do end up going!

In contrast, the opposite of setting goals, aimlessness, in Buddhism is known as the [Third Door of Liberation](https://awaken.com/2021/10/what-are-the-three-doors-of-liberation/) - and who would not want to be liberated. To explore the merits of non-goal setting or aimlessness, one can try this simple exercise suggested by late Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh:

>Try practicing aimlessness for just five minutes, and you will see how happy you are during those five minutes.

. . .

If you find yourself agreeing with me at this point, you probably haven't thought this through. 

We don't just arbitrarily set goals. We set goals, since doing so is deeply embedded in our culture, and our culture is deeply embedded in us. As a norther German, I should know, since I grew up near what can be described as the medieval epicentre of the movement that leads to today's self-improvement craze: the reformation and the resulting [protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism). 

The idea in the west for centuries has been that the gift of God's salvation should be repaid through hard work.
