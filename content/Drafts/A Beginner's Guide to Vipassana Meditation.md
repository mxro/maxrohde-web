## History and Background

Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices. The method comes directly from the [Satipatthana Sutta [Foundations of Mindfulness]](https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/satipatthana-sutta-mindfulness/), a discourse attributed to the [Buddha](https://tricycle.org/beginners/buddhism/who-was-the-buddha/) himself.

In Vipassana mediation, the meditator uses his concentration as a tool by which his awareness can chip away at the wall of illusion that cuts him off from the living light of reality. It is a gradual process of ever-increasing awareness into the inner workings of reality itself. It takes years, but one day the meditator chisels through that wall and tumbles into the presence of light. The transformation is complete. It’s called Liberation, and it’s permanent. Liberation is the goal of all Buddhist systems of practice. But the routes to the attainment of that end are quite diverse.

The Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha’s original discourse on mindfulness, specifically says that one must begin by focusing the attention on the breathing and then go on to note all other physical and mental phenomena which arise.

## Step by Step Instructions


## Breath
At the beginning of the sitting, it may be helpful to take a few deep, long breaths, inhaling, and then slowly exhaling. As you exhale, allow your body to release tension in those areas where you habitually hold it—perhaps the shoulders, chest, stomach, or the back. With each exhalation, feel your body soften and relax. Sometimes it can be helpful to extend and lengthen the breath at the beginning of a sitting, so that you begin to focus on the entirety of the inhalation and the exhalation, and on the pauses or apertures between the inhalation and the exhalation and between the exhalation and the inhalation.

Focus on the breath as the primary object. Be aware of the breath at the nostrils or wherever it’s clearest to you. If your normal breathing is through the mouth, be aware of the breath coming and going through the mouth.

Notice the physical sensation of the breath touching at mouth or nostrils, the coolness of the in-breath, the warm softness of the out-breath.

Know when you’re breathing in; know when you’re breathing out. Allow the breath to find its own rhythm and flow. You are not controlling it, just observing it, trusting in the body and the breath. Knowing when you’re breathing in, and knowing when you’re breathing out, your breath becomes the primary object.

Know when you are breathing in. Know when you are breathing out. Know when you are breathing in a long breath. Know when you are breathing out a long breath. Know when you are breathing in a short breath. Know when you are breathing out a short breath.
## Body

When sensations in the body become predominant, when they’re calling the attention away from the breathing, let the mind go to the sensation that is predominant; open to it, feel it. Note what kind of sensation it is. Is it heat or cold, heaviness or lightness, is it vibration or tingling, is it a painful sensation or a pleasant one?

Invite the facial muscles to soften, relaxing from the inside out. Any tightness in the face, any holding, can release. As you smile and relax into your body, tension can let go.
- Let the lower jaw hang open so that the lips separate a bit and any tension in the joints of the jaw can release. Invite a slight smile in the corners of the mouth, the inner smile, Buddha smile, a feeling of lightness in the corners of the mouth.
- Smile into the moment and into your body. Be aware of any sensations as you smile into your body. Perhaps sensations are apparent, perhaps not; either way, it’s okay.
If tightness in the legs or back or itching, tingling, pain, any physical sensation becomes predominant, turn your attention to the sensation and note it three times: “sensation, sensation, sensation.” If you prefer, note it more specifically as, “tingling, tingling, tingling,” “tightness, tightness, tightness,” or “itching, itching, itching.” Don’t note it as, “I have pain in my right knee,” which snares you into the story of the pain and a self who owns that discomfort. Just observe the sensation and note it in any appropriate way.

If emotion arises and predominates, know that you are experiencing that emotion. Note it as, “anger, anger, anger,” or perhaps as, “fear, fear, fear,” or bliss, joy, jealousy, restlessness, boredom—whatever it may be. Again, note, “anger, anger, anger,” not, “I’m feeling angry about what he said,” so as not to become entangled in the story, only to know that this mind-body is experiencing anger.

## Senses



## Concentration

The breath is the primary object, but concentration is not held here with force. With natural concentration, you focus attention on what is dominant in your experience. If a physical sensation, thought, image, or emotion pulls attention away from the breath, know that your attention has moved from the breath. Know when your attention has moved to physical sensation, thinking, image, or emotion.

People sometimes think, because a strong sensation, thought, image, or emotion draws their attention and they’re not with the breath, that they’re not meditating, that they’re being distracted, or that they’re not concentrating. Actually, focusing upon that strong sensation develops deeper concentration, because the mind is holding to an object. That’s a very powerful focus. It’s a fine opportunity to develop concentration and mindfulness.

If you find that an intense sensation keeps pulling your attention away from the breath towards that sensation, turn your attention to it. Lightly note it, creating some space for the experience, placing awareness on the sensation.

If the sensation is unpleasant, watch the tendency to want to push the sensation away, to not want it. Without judgment of the aversion, just notice what arises. Move deeply into the sensation and see how it may change, how it may not be one block of pain, one strong sensation, but little sensations that are arising, changing, and ceasing with varying levels of intensity.

If the sensation is pleasant, watch the tendency to want to hold on to it. Let there be no judgment of the attachment, just notice it arise. How does sensation change as you touch it with merciful, nonjudgmental awareness? What about the attachment to that pleasant sensation?

Are some sensations neutral, calling up neither like nor dislike?

## Deepening



- Become a witness, note (impartially) what you experience
- It is helpful to establish mindfulness of body at the beginning of practice. We tend to be less in our bodies and more in our minds and the content of thoughts.
- Let go of desires
- Accept all sensations, thoughts, feelings, and emotions 
- Be neutral: don't judge your thoughts and feelings as good or bad


## Tips and Tricks



opening to the feeling or the sensation of each breath, each movement of the rise and fall or in and out, without any expectation of how any particular breath should be, not trying to force it into a particular pattern, not thinking that there should be any one kind of sensation. It is a settling back into each moment, with a great deal of care and precision, and being open to what is revealed in that particular breath. What is the sensation of this rising, or this in-breath? What is the feeling of it? Is it long or short, is it rough or smooth, is it deep or shallow, is there heaviness or pressure or tingling?
