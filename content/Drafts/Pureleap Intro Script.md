Shally: 

Hey there, we're Shally and Max, the team behind Pureleap. We both come from different backgrounds - I used to be a law partner in New Zealand, but found it wasn't for me. So, I switched to become a graduate software developer which I absolutely love. 

Max:

And I'm Max, an IT executive who has previously worked as a developer and university lecturer.

We created Pureleap because we noticed that there are many problems with the modern workplace and life in general. 

Shally:

One of the biggest issues is that work takes up so much of our time and energy, leaving little room for things like family and self-care. It's all too easy for enjoyable activities to become sources of stress when there's just too much on our plates.

Max:

But why is this happening? Well, it's largely due to our economic system where companies are incentivized to get as much out of workers as they can. However, we also play a role in this cycle by constantly striving to advance our careers and earn more money.

Shally:

As a result, we end up spending more money which means we have to work even harder just to keep up with our lifestyles. This not only puts a strain on us but also on our environment since everything we buy and consume requires natural resources.

Max:

That's why we created Pureleap - to explore a new way of living and working.

Our idea is simple: live simply so that you need less while still leading a happy life. Pursue meaningful work that brings you joy instead of just chasing after money.

Shally:

Right now, our goal is to share what we learn along the way through social media posts on Instagram, podcast episodes, blog articles and YouTube videos.

We'd love for you to join us on this journey and say hi anytime!

Shally:

Thank you for stepping by. In this short video, we will brielfy discuss what Pureleap is all about and what got us there.

I am Shalveena and I have been a law partner in New Zealand. But I found that wasn't really for me. I have since changed to be a graduate software developer which I enjoy much better.

Max:

I am Max and I am an IT executive. I have previously worked as a developer and also as university lecturer.

We are the wife and husband team currently making up Pureleap.

We found that there are many things wrong with the modern workplace and also with modern life in general.

Shally:

The first problem with work is that it often takes too much time and energy. There is little space for family, looking after your own well being and looking after others. Also, because there is just too much of it, many things that could be enjoyable, can instead be a source of stress.

Max:

This is a natural result of our economic system. Companies are incentiviced to get as much out of workers as they can get away with. But really speaking we are often the ones at fault.

We are constantly striving to advance our careers, to earn more.

Shally:

And then we spend more. Spending more requires us then to work more but also results in us using up more natural resources. The things we buy and consume must come from somewhere.

We are all caught up in this cycle. And there are few ways to escape available to us.

Max:

We started Pureleap to explore a new way to live and work. It's based on the following idea: To live simply, so that we need less while still living a happy life, and to seek purposeful and joyous work. And the less we need to live, the more freedom we have to choose meaningful work.

Shally:

For now, our objective is to explore this idea and share what we learn along the way. You'll see us posting about our journey on instagram, talk about in our podcast, writing blog posts and occasionally uploading a video to YouTube.

Please join us and also don't hesitate at all to say hi.

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. In this quick video, we want to tell you a bit about Pureleap and how we got started.

I'm Shalveena and I used to be a law partner in New Zealand, but I quickly realized that it wasn't the right fit for me. So, I made the switch to become a graduate software developer and I'm loving it.

And I'm Max. I've been an IT executive, a developer, and even a university lecturer.

Together, we're the husband and wife team behind Pureleap. We started this venture because we noticed some major problems with the modern workplace and life in general.

One of the biggest issues is that work takes up so much time and energy that there's often little left over for family, self-care, or helping others. And because we're constantly pushing ourselves to advance our careers and earn more money, even things that should be enjoyable end up causing stress.

But here's the thing: it's not all on the companies. We're just as responsible for getting caught up in this cycle of work-spending-more work-consuming resources.

So, we kicked off Pureleap as a way to explore a new way of living and working. Our idea is simple: live simply so that you need less while still leading a happy life. Pursue meaningful work that brings you joy instead of just chasing after money.

Right now, our goal is to share what we learn along the way through social media posts on Instagram, podcast episodes, blog articles...and hey, who knows? Maybe even some YouTube videos!

We'd love for you to join us on this journey and say hi anytime!
