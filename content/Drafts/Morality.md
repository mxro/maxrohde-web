I'm currently reading the book The Pragmatist's Guide to Life, a guide to creating your own answers to life's biggest questions by Malcolm Collins and Simone Collins. A central theme of this book is morality or what is good and what is bad. 

In that it is very close to the heart of moral philosophy, which is the study of moral values and rules. And morality is ultimately about what is good or bad or what are good or bad actions.

Similar discussions are found in the book [How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5191978423) by Michael Schur.

However, while Schur's book focuses on reviewing the body of knowledge of moral philosophy and being grounded by it, the pragmatist guide especially emphasizes that they do not want to draw on ready-made philosophies, Instead, wanting to equip the reader to come up with their own personal philosophy.

The Pragmatist's Guide to Life begins with a chapter to help everyone find their so-called objective function. The objective function is defined as "the thing we attempt to maximize/minimize in/with our lives" or "metric by which we judge the ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù of any action or decision we make".

I found these discussions in the book somewhat unhelpful and would like to unravel here why that is and present a better alternative.

The main fault I see in the pragmatists' guide of discussion of morality is that it seems a bit too rational. They authors emphasizes that it would be lazy thinking not to think through the foundations of our morality to the end.

For instance, when the objective function of maximizing one's own personal happiness is discussed, the following question is posed to the reader.

>You are given the option to spend the rest of your life in a tube that enables you to live twice as long as you would outside of the tube. The tube pumps your brain full of the chemicals necessary to constantly feel whatever emotional state it is that you value the most (or whatever series of emotions you think has the most value in exactly the amounts you deem as having the most value). This tube will better serve an objective function to maximize positive feelings than any life you could live independently. Will you choose to live in the tube, even though it means foregoing normal life and leaving everyone you have known? (The tube would be able to maximize the feelings you got from the interactions you used to have with these individuals.)

These kinds of thought experiments are actually a hallmark of moral philosophy, where we for instance have the famous [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem):

> There is a runaway [trolley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram "Tram") barrelling down the [railway tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_(rail_transport) "Track (rail transport)"). Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two (and only two) options:
> 
> 1. Do nothing, in which case the trolley will kill the five people on the main track.
> 2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.
> 
> Which is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do?

I think these kinds of problems are good to consider for someone studying the field of moral philosophy in an academic capacity. However, for most of us who just want to go about our lives in a simple and good way, I'm not sure this kind of rigor is necessarily required or beneficial.

Most of us are neither as smart as Immanuel Kant nor do we have the time to spend as much considerations on philosophical problems.

And I think these kind of rational approaches also somewhat de-emphasize our situation as biological beings that are constrained and enabled by the way that nature made us.

Thus, in order to define what is good or bad and have our actions guided by that, I propose the following principles.

## Principles

### Driven by Nature

First, acknowledge that we are the way that nature made us. What we consider good or bad will be influenced by our biological programming.

We are a social and cooperative species. Thus, it just feels right for us to help others, especially those that are in need.

Does this mean by an absolute objective measure this is good? No, absolutely not. However, I question that we could adopt a morality which may be rational but opposed to the very foundations which make us as beings.

### Aim for 80%

Next, looking at the question of what is good or bad, it is easy to make the argument that this is such an important and fundamental question that we shouldn't allow for any inaccuracies or lazy thinking as the pragmatist guide suggests.

However, I doubt that given our current knowledge and possibly never that it will be possible for us to find a 100% accurate answer on what is good or bad.

Thus, given that this is impossible, I think we should set our standards a little bit lower and maybe just aim for something that is mostly correct when deciding what is good or bad.

### Values and Rules are Not Universal

If we accept that we cannot find a 100% correct answer, the consequence of that is that in the end, different people could come up with different answers and all of them should be able to co-exist.

Thus, we should not strive to find absolutely universal rules that apply to each and everyone, and that we should phrolesticize for people to follow.

Given the above three principles, how could some core values rules someone could adapt look like? Here an example.

Thus, values should be less than a mathematical equation but more than a soup. Something palatable to humans and all the better for when it has more than one ingredient.

## Values

### Suffering üëç

- Human suffering is usually bad.
- Suffering in beings we are able to empathize with is usually bad.

### Happiness, Joy and Contentment üëé

- Happiness, joy and contentment for humans are usually good.
- Happiness, joy and contentment for beings we are able to empathize with are usually good.

### Complex Systems üëç

## Rules

### Be kind

Kindness has the great benefit of naturally feeling right for us and at the same time also being shown to increase our own happiness. as well as increasing the life and happiness of those that we are being kind to.

### Be an example

Live your life in a way that it is an example to others. Your own actions, it can be very helpful to think of them in a way that if they are a good template for others to do the same.

## Be net-positive

Have the lives of your loved ones be better lives with you rather than without you. Have your life increase the well-being over other beings overall. Increase the health and abundance of nature rather than exploit it unsustainably through your live.

Example above provides very simple rules that can help to judge what is a good or bad action. Does it work for everyone and can stand up to every thought experiment? Probably not, but as per the principles above, they don't have to.
