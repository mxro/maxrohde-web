title: Practices for Enlightenment
---

I believe we all have moments in which we become the best versions of ourselves; moments in which we are ever so slightly closer to true and deep enlightenment.

Unfortunately, these moments are rare and we digress from whatever insights we have gained easily. For instance, we might realise that binge watching television brings little happiness into our lives but comes with significant costs such as less time to spent with family and friends or for our health. We might then decide to spent less time watching television and more time on more meaningful endeavours.

This decision alone, however, is not sufficient for the outcome we decide upon to manifest. Often, we will try for a few days but then the hustle and bustle of life engulfs us and we quickly forget what we have set out to do.

I believe that to attain wisdom and foster goodness in our lives, we need to constantly remind ourselves of what is most important to us. So that, once we have decided to be good and happy, we can stand a chance against the demands of everyday life. One of the ways to do that is by following a set of practices: sequences of steps we do regularly and with a spiritual purpose.

This has motivated me to design the following simple practices, which may help in achieving a more balanced, meaningful and enlightened life:

- [Practice: Body Mindfulness](https://maxrohde.com/2019/03/23/practice-body-mindfulness/)
- [Practice: Thought Mindfulness](https://maxrohde.com/2019/03/31/practice-thought-mindfulness/)
- [Practice: Forgiveness](https://maxrohde.com/2019/04/07/practice-forgiveness/)
- [Practice: Joy](https://maxrohde.com/2019/04/14/practice-joy/)
- [Practice: Exercise](https://maxrohde.com/2019/04/19/practice-exercise/)
- [Practice: Gratitude](https://maxrohde.com/2019/04/21/practice-gratitude/)
- [Practice: Interbeing](https://maxrohde.com/2019/04/27/practice-interbeing/)
- [Practice: Equanimity](https://maxrohde.com/2019/05/05/practice-equanimity/)
- [Practice: Love](https://maxrohde.com/2019/05/11/practice-love/)
- [Practice: Irrelevance and Impermanence](https://maxrohde.com/2019/05/19/practice-irrelevance-and-impermanence/)
- [Practice: Healing Compassion](https://maxrohde.com/2019/11/02/practice-healing-compassion/)
- [Practice: Mind Focus](https://maxrohde.com/2022/11/13/practice-mind-focus-meditation)

I believe these practices can enable us to be stronger and wiser. Of course, we need to find a way to embed them into our lives in a regular manner, for instance every morning or every evening; since a practice can only unfold its power when practised repeatedly.
