title: 'Habit Tracking September: Technological Enhancement'
---

As written before, I have adopted a [new system for tracking my habits](https://maxrohde.com/2019/08/03/simple-habit-tracking-system/). This primarily involves keeping track of whether or not I am getting to do certain activities in a day or not and recording this in a simple table. I have already reported my success in tracking my habits for [July](https://maxrohde.com/2019/08/03/simple-habit-tracking-system/) and [August](https://maxrohde.com/2019/09/02/habit-tracking-august-a-complete-failure/).

While things were going very well in July, August saw me struggling to stick to any of the habits; chiefly I think, since I struggled with a winter cold (living in Australia, yes, we have winter in August).

Here the overview for September:

Habit Tracking September

Overall I did not very terribly, and here my notes for the individual habits:

- **Exercise & Stretching**: While I only managed to exercise (and stretch four times in August), I increased this to six times in September. I think I could have done even better if I hadn't been very busy at work at the end of September and thus wasn't able to come back home in time to exercise in the evening. Also I had a little accident on my scooter on the 26th of September where I injured my rib. I can still barely walk without pain, so I don't think I will be able to exercise until this is healed.
- **Wake Up**: We changed our morning routine to wake up a bit later and thus the 5:30 am wake up time wasn't really practical to pursue.
- **Meditation**: No excuse why I didn't do my meditation. Have to do better next month.
- **Learn**: I was able to practice touch typing quite consistently. I am still learning to type special characters such as `[]{}()=><`. Also, my wife gave me the book [Visual Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/31944884-visual-thinking) as a birthday present and I have been practising to draw with the help of this book.
- **Posture**: Finally coming to the subtitle of the book, I have at long last found a way to work on my posture in an effective way. As another birthday present from my wife I received an [Upright Go](https://www.uprightpose.com/en-au/), that I have been using to train my posture. Unfortunately this is also at present hindered by my injury.

For the next month, I will try to continue working on the same habits but will replace _Wake Up_ with _Emails_, where I set myself the goal to have less than five emails in my personal inbox at any point in the day.
