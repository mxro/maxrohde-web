title: 'Habit Tracking October: Injured and Distracted'

Following my [new system for tracking habits](https://maxrohde.com/2019/08/03/simple-habit-tracking-system/) I have again kept track of various habits I try to follow. Here the overview for October.

Habit Tracking October

Overall, I didn't do very well, just like in [September](https://maxrohde.com/2019/10/03/habit-tracking-september-technological-enhancement/). Here my notes on the individual habits:

- **Exercise and Stretching**: Since I injured my rib at the end of September, I was not able to do much exercise. The two times I managed to do so I went on strenuous walks, first to the [Werribee Gorge](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/werribee-gorge-state-park) and then to the [1000 Steps](https://visitdandenongranges.com.au/1000-steps).
- **Emails**: I have adopted a new habit where I aim to have less than five emails in my personal inbox (certainly not possible with my work one). I managed to do so quite consistently. I think it stresses me when too many emails pile up in my personal inbox so I think keeping things managed day by day is a good habit to adopt.
- **Meditation**: While I was not being very good at meditating regularly in October, I improved somewhat from September. I also developed for myself a little meditation map that I followed:

Meditation Map

- **Learn**: For the latter half of the month I was not very diligent in continuing my touch typing practice. I think this was due to me being involved in a small programming project; I taught myself how to develop 3D graphics using JavaScript. So, in a way I did some learning during most of these days just not the kind I planned for.

3D Application

- **Posture**: I was able to use my Upright go for around half of the days in the months. Should definitely try to do better.

For the next month my main goal will definitely be to pick up exercising again. For me, it is the most important habit but one I often fail to adhere to.
