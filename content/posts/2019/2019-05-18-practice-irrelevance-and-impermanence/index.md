The universe is very big. We are very small. The universe exists for an immeasurably long time. Our lives are very short. These are simple facts that we often forget. An omission which easily leads us to overestimate the importance of our life, actions and feelings in the greater context of existence.

Western culture is built around the idea that  there lies tremendous value in each and every individual. The following two quotations from the Declaration of Independence and the German Basic law illustrate the Western focus on the individual and their protection from the area of Enlightenment and modernity respectively:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

[Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)

> Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority. \[...\] Every person shall have the right to free development of his personality insofar as he does not violate the rights of others or offend against the constitutional order or the moral law. \[...\] Every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity. Freedom of the person shall be inviolable. 

[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany](https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf)

I believe that this understanding of basic human rights is the foundation of the peace and prosperity my generation enjoys. These documents provide a very robust legal framework for creating a peaceful and functioning society. However, they are a poor spiritual guide in that they omit some fundamental truths about our existence - that there is little factual grounds for imbuing our puny lives with such outsize importance (the original justification for this was found in Christianity - as God endowing the 'unalienable rights'.)

We cannot find true enlightenment if we do not face what is fact to the best of our knowledge. Thus we need to overcome the basic assumption that each and every life, and especially our own life, is inherently immeasurably valuable. This thought at first might not sound very comforting; but it can be a source of tremendous strength. You don't need to be special; there is no point. You can focus on what has been given to you, your simple, small and short life and embrace all that is good within it, without having to believe in some false higher purpose.

> Short is the time which every man lives, and small the nook of earth where he lives, and short too the longest posthumous fame, and even this only continued by a succession of poor human beings.

Marcus Aurelius

One of the key concepts in Buddhist philosophy is the understanding that life is suffering, and that the impermanence of everything - people, thoughts, objects - is one of the key drivers of this suffering. It is a truly inalienable fact of life and, to find peace and wisdom, we need to understand and acknowledge it:

> The world is afflicted by death and decay. But the wise do not grieve, having realised the nature of the world. 

[Salla Sutta: The Arrow](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.3.08.irel.html)

Impermanence and suffering are two of the 'three marks of existence' in Buddhism with the third one being the concept of non-self. Non-self in essence asserts that there is no permanent self or soul in any living beings. For me, it is one of the more esoteric theories in Buddhism and I tend to classify it into the category of deliberations which easily leads us around in circles while being of little use. What I like to take away from it is the insight that what we perceive as our 'self' is mostly an illusion and believing that we have an immortal, immeasurable valuable soul is a belief held easily only with a good helping of self-aggrandisement.

The following practice is based on two basic understandings: Firstly, that we are impermanent and, secondly, that we are irrelevant in the sense that there is no magic to our lives which make them meaningful beyond the observable. 

1. Become aware of the place where you currently are.
2. Grasp in your mind the people who are in your building, then your suburb, then your city, then your country and finally the whole earth; each one so very similar to you and you being such a small part of them all.
3. Become aware of the moment in time that currently is. Realise that in a hundred years you will have ceased to exist and your moment and struggles will mean little to those succeeding you. (If you happen to think you are rich and famous or have the opportunity to become so, add one hundred thousand years to the time-frame in this exercise.)
4. Understand that by realising this you are acknowledging a fundamental truth of who you are and your place in the world. Your impermanence and irrelevance notwithstanding embrace the miracle of your existence, the ability to think and feel; the miracle that you may behold the beauty of the world, and to cherish the opportunity to add your microscopic ripple to the ocean of time and matter surrounding your life.

This practice and its theoretical justification is similar to the practice of [embracing interbeing](http://spearoflight.blog/2019/04/27/practice-interbeing/) discussed earlier. The practice for embracing interbeing is only different in that it focuses on the connectedness of things while this practice is more inward bound, in asserting our place and identity in what we know existence to be.

In contrast to the practices of [love](http://spearoflight.blog/2019/05/11/practice-love/), [forgiveness](http://spearoflight.blog/2019/04/07/practice-forgiveness/) and [gratitude](http://spearoflight.blog/2019/04/21/practice-gratitude/) this practice is not immediately comforting. In fact it can be quite disturbing. It might be easier to live our lives if indeed there was any form of evidence that there is something magical which makes each of our lives worthwhile and valuable. Alas there is not. Given this, we need to face the facts as we are able to comprehend them. True enlightenment requires to be truthful to ourselves and finding wisdom within the constraints brought to us by the observable world:

> Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.

[Sahassavagga: The Thousands](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.08.budd.html#dhp-113)
