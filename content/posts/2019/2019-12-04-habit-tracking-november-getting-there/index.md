title: 'Habit Tracking November: Getting There'
---

After having done [very poorly on keeping to my habits in October](https://maxrohde.com/2019/11/05/habit-tracking-october-injured-and-distracted/), things have greatly improved in November. Here the overview for November:

Habit Tracking November

Some things to note:

- **Exercise**: While in October, I was only able to do exercise twice due to being injured, I exercised eleven times in November. For some time, I thought that I would be able to go running every day. Unfortunately my muscles got too stiff and I needed to take a break (that would be between 21/11 and 25/11). We went on a short trip to Brisbane around the 7/11 and I am especially pleased I was able to exercise notwithstanding the travel. I went running on the beach which is nice in itself as well.
- **Meditation**: I still was not too successful with meditating. To some degree this was due to me not being able to find a bit of quite time in the morning.
- **Emails**: I was quite successful at keeping my email inbox empty. I like spending a little bit of time every day rather than having to 'clean up' the inbox in one go on the weekend, which feels more like a chore. Sometimes I still get frustrated though if I find 15-20 emails in my inbox after having cleared it the previous day (this excludes work emails). Most of these are not spam emails and require me to do one or the other thing.
- **Posture**: I feel like my back pain is getting worse. I was able to use the Upright Go quite frequently but I think I need to take further action, such as doing specific stretches and exercises.
- **Learn**: My speed for doing my current touch typing exercise (lots of special characters, see below) was between 43 and 50 words per minute in October; in November, it was between 43 and 53 words per minute with a higher average as well. I also did a touch typing test for typing more common words ([typingtest.com/](https://www.typingtest.com/)); my speed was around 50 to 55 - still not as fast as my wife, who gets 60 plus.

Touch Typing and Writing

This is the text I am currently practice to touch type. I upload this to [speedcoder.net](http://www.speedcoder.net/) as custom code.

```
(p)
(p)
(elem)
(elem)
(a, b)
(a, b)
(a, b)
(a, b)
(x, y)
(x, y)
(x, y)
(x, y)
=>
=>
=>
=>
=>
a => b
a => b
a => b
a => b
{ al }
{ al }
{ al }
{ al }
(a) => { b };
(a) => { b };
(a) => { b };
(a) => { b };
(a) => { b(p1); };
(a) => { b(p1); };
(a) => { b(p1); };
(a) => { b(p1); };
const f1 = (p) => { b(); };
const f1 = (p) => { b(); };
const f1 = (p) => { b(); };
const f1 = (p) => { b(); };
```

Apart from this, I started a larger project in November about organising the quotes I have collected. I had collected them in multiple Word documents (organised by topic). I realised this was a very poor way to organise them and are now working on bringing all quotes into a database using [airtable](https://airtable.com/).

For the next months, I again want to focus on exercising as much as possible and also to work on my posture.
