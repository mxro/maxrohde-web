title: Next.js + Bootstrap Boilerplate
---

I has been nearly two years since I first wrote about a [Next.js + Bootstrap starter project](https://maxrohde.com/2020/03/06/next-js-with-bootstrap-getting-started/) on this blog. Since then I have been extending the base template and made it easier to configure and use. It is now available as one of the templates on [Goldstack](https://goldstack.party): [Next.js + Bootstrap Template](https://goldstack.party/templates/nextjs-bootstrap).

While I think using the starter project builder is a great way to launch a new project, it can sometimes be useful to see the source code of a working project; either to clone the whole project to adapt it to your needs, or just to copy and paste the parts you need (commonly known as boilerplate, see for instance [Next.js boilerplate](https://dev.to/joeygoksu/the-ultimate-collection-of-production-ready-nestjs-boilerplate-2d4h), [GraphQL boilerplate](https://dev.to/tuanlc/graphql-clean-architectire-boilerplate-hog) and [React Native boilerplate](https://dev.to/joeygoksu/the-ultimate-react-native-boilerplate-with-typescript-3778)).

Thus, I have created a [**Next.js + Bootstrap boilerplate**](https://github.com/goldstack/nextjs-bootstrap-boilerplate) project on GitHub. This project is automatically generated from the base Goldstack template, so when the template is updated, the boilerplate will automatically be updated as well.
