[Next.js 12](https://nextjs.org/) has been released [a few months ago](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12). It is a major update to the Next.js framework that includes a lot of [new features and improvements](https://dev.to/logrocket/whats-new-in-nextjs-12-4oh1). Goldstack provides two templates based on Next.js:

---

[**Next.js Template**](https://goldstack.party/templates/nextjs)

for building vanilla Next.js applications

---

[**Next.js + Bootstrap Template**](https://goldstack.party/templates/nextjs-bootstrap)

for building Next.js application that use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styling.

---

Both of these templates have been updated and tested with Next.js 12. For the Next.js + Bootstrap template you can also use the [Next.js + Bootstrap boilerplate](https://github.com/goldstack/nextjs-bootstrap-boilerplate).

Both Next.js templates still come packed with the following features:

- [Low-cost, scaleable deployment to AWS](https://dev.to/mxro/serverless-nextjs-on-aws-with-terraform-11-1081)
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- Optimised for Yarn workspaces - can easily be combined with other Goldstack templates, such as a [Serverless API](https://goldstack.party/templates/serverless-api) or [Express API](https://goldstack.party/templates/express-lambda).
