title: 'Memory System Part 4: Symbolic Systems'
---

In the earlier parts of this series I have discussed the [possible modern applications of ancient memory techniques](https://spearoflight.wordpress.com/2021/11/15/memory-system-part-1-ancient-techniques-and-modern-applications/). I mentioned that not everyone was convinced of the merits of some of the key tenants of the proposed system, chiefly its reliance on adding imagined images to what needs to be learned - specifically to create images for abstract ideas. Probably most important for our modern experience of learning would be the distaste of this approach by the Puritian architects of our education systems, for instance [Erasmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus). I myself have some reservations about the utility of transforming ideas into images, especially if it is done in an arbitrary way.

However, I think we also have a rich and long history of using specific images and symbols to represent abstract ideas and I believe that some of these can be used as memory aids; giving us images for abstract concepts, which we then can combine with what we want to remember.

## Years - Chinese Zodiac Signs

We often need to arrange information by time and the twelve Chinese Zodiac signs provide a possible way to associate images to specific years within a twelve year window. I believe they are particularily useful for organising knowledge that lies a few years in the past or future. They are less useful for aiding as images for historical dates, especially if these span many decades (they can be useful though for remembering a cluster of dates within the same decate).

The following provides the Chinese Zodiac signs for the a twelve year window, starting in 2020.

<table><tbody><tr><td>1 - 2020</td><td>Rat</td></tr><tr><td>2 - 2021</td><td>Ox</td></tr><tr><td>3 - 2022</td><td>Tiger</td></tr><tr><td>4 - 2023</td><td>Rabbit</td></tr><tr><td>5 - 2024</td><td>Dragon</td></tr><tr><td>6 - 2025</td><td>Snake</td></tr><tr><td>7 - 2026</td><td>Horse</td></tr><tr><td>8 - 2027</td><td>Goat</td></tr><tr><td>9 - 2029</td><td>Monkey</td></tr><tr><td>10 - 2030</td><td>Rooster</td></tr><tr><td>11 - 2031</td><td>Dog</td></tr><tr><td>12 - 2032</td><td>Pig</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Months - Western Astrological Signs

The signs of the western astrological calendar align roughly to the 12 months of the year. See the following table for an approximate mapping:

<table><tbody><tr><td>Janurary</td><td>♑︎ Goat, Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>♒︎ Water Bearer, Aquarious,</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>♓︎ Fish, Pisces</td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>♈︎ Ram, Aries</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>♉︎ Bullm Taurus</td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>♊︎ Twins, Gemini</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>♋︎ Crab, Cancer</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>♌︎ Lion, Leo</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>♍︎ Maiden, Virgo</td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>♎︎ Scales, Libra</td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>♏︎ Scorpion, Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>♐︎ Archer / Centaur, Sagittarius</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Numbers - Shapes

A way to represent an ordered list or a specific number is to associate them with geometrical shapes of a matching number of points. The following list combines both two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes to arrive at easy to recognise shapes.

| Number | Geometrical Figure              | Image       |
