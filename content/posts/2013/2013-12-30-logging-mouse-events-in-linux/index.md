**Problem**

You would like to obtain statistics about how often the mouse is used on a Linux machine.

**Solution**

Linux logs all activity of input devices (such as mouse and keyboard) into various [device files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file) under /dev/input/\*.

Mouse activities, in particular, are logged in /dev/input/mice (this logs events for all mice attached). Hooking into this device file allows to be notified of all mouse events. The following C++ snippet reads the /dev/input/mice file and writes a simple log for the observed activity:

\[code language="cpp"\]#include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <time.h> #include <linux/input.h>

#define MOUSEFILE "/dev/input/mice"

int main() { int fd; struct input\_event ie;

if((fd = open(MOUSEFILE, O\_RDONLY)) == -1) { perror("Cannot access mouse device"); exit(EXIT\_FAILURE); }

while(read(fd, &ie, sizeof(struct input\_event))) { time\_t rawtime; struct tm \* timeinfo;

time ( &rawtime ); timeinfo = localtime ( &rawtime ); printf ( "Actvy: %s", asctime (timeinfo) ); }

return 0; }\[/code\]

Safe the source code into a file mouse.c and compile this application using the following command:

\[code\]gcc mouse.c -o LogMouse\[/code\]

You can run the compiled program as follows to log mouse events from your system in a text file:

\[code\]./LogMouse > mouse.txt\[/code\]

Note: You will probably need root privileges to run this application, so use sodu or su.
