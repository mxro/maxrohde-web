title: A beautiful Black Tick
---

When creating documents, tables and presentations, I am often looking for a simple symbol to express a 'tick' as in 'this is okay' or 'this is supported'.

Especially the Microsoft Office applications (Word, PowerPoint, ...) do not seem to provide such a tick symbol in an easily accessible locations (I couldn't find it yet).

Luckily, there is [openclipart.org](http://openclipart.org), an amazing collection of public domain symbols, icons and other vector graphic images. There is a beautiful [green tick](http://openclipart.org/detail/167549/green-tick---simple-by-kliponius) available on this platform. I have modified this symbol to be in black color. You can download it below and use it to your heart's delight:

And change the '?w=400' to the size you desire. For instance, '?w=200' for a 200px version.
