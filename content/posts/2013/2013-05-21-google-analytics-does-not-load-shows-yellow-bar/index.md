title: 'Google Analytics Does Not Load â€“ Shows Yellow Bar'

## The Problem

You can load the page [http://www.google.com/analytics/](http://www.google.com/analytics/) without any problem but when you click on \[Sign In\] the following happens:

A yellow bar appears briefly on the screen before it unceremoniously turns blank.

## Solution

This problem appears to be caused by the popular Chrome plugin [Ad Block Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?hl=en). When the empty page is loaded, a small red stop sign with the text ABP should appear next to the URL.
