title: 'NZISDC: The Inaugural New Zealand Information Systems Doctoral Conference'
---

The inaugural New Zealand Information Systems Doctoral Conference (NZISDC) has been developed as a forum for all New Zealand Information Systems PhD students to present their research-in-progress -- current research ideas, approaches, interests, issues, and methodologies -- and to receive feedback from fellow students and leading academics in the field. The Conference offers IS doctoral students the opportunity to learn what their peers are focusing on in their research and meet with distinguished faculty in Information Systems from New Zealand's eight universities. NZISDC is open to all New Zealand Information Systems PhD students (at any stage of their research), their supervisors and Information Systems academic staff at all New Zealand universities.

See the [NZISDC](http://www.massey.ac.nz/~dviehlan/NZISDC.html) Website for the Call for Abstracts, Sponsorship Opportunities, Registration Form and Preliminary Programme.
