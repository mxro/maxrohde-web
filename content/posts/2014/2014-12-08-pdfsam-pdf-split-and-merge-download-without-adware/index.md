title: 'pdfsam/ PDF Split and Merge: Download without Adware'
---

[PDFSAM](http://www.pdfsam.org/) or PDF Split and Merge is a wonderful tool for working with PDF files (e.g. split one PDF into multiple files, join multiple PDFs into one file or reordering the pages within a PDF file).

Unfortunately, the default installer available [from their home page](http://www.pdfsam.org/download/) or source forge comes bundled with some 'free tools' to improve your browsers search bar. Some adware scanners might thus strongly discourage you to use this otherwise awesome applications.

Thankfully there the developer also provides a download link for an installer without Adware. Just download any of the files fromÂ the link below and be sure not to install any unwanted additions:
