'[JavaScript and JSON Essentials](http://www.packtpub.com/javascript-and-json-essentials/book?utm_source=Create.com&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=JSON)' by Packt publishing is a hands-on guide to developing JavaScript/PHP based web applications while using the JSON data format. This review of the book contains a quick summary of the contents as well as points to consider if you think of purchasing the book.

Overall, this as an easy to read book suited for novices in web development, packed with examples and easy to follow step-by-step instructions. However, advanced JavaScript developers will be familiar with most of the concepts covered in the book.

## Caveat Emptor

- Don't expect to become a grandmaster of JavaScript after reading the JavaScript intro of the book. It's around 14 pages and only meant to give a brief idea of JavaScript. If you are new to JavaScript, consider a complementary book such as [Object-Oriented JavaScript](http://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-javascript/book) or [JavaScript The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do).
- This book, as its title specifies covers the 'Essentials' of JavaScript and JSON. Thus it's a good starting point to become familiar with these technologies but does not contain more advanced or nuanced discussions, such as good design practices for JSON documents, performance issues or tradeoffs in using JSON.
