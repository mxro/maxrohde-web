title: Lebanese Green Beans
---

If you don't like green breans, if you think they are boring and easily overcooked, you've got to try these!

These beans are out of this world! I am absolutely NOT a bean lover...in fact, I tend to subconsciously avoid them! But my oh my, I'm now a fan. These beans are slowly cooked for 1 hour and the result is flavourful, slightly sweet, garlicy and 100% lick-you-fingers delicious.

Go on, try them!

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup olive oil

- 2 onions, thinly sliced

- 10 - 12 cloves garlic, sliced

- 900g green beans, ends trimmed and halved

- Approx 700g tomatoes, chopped (I used a mix of small, sweet tomatoes and normal tomatoes)

- 2 Tbsp tomato paste

- 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder

- 2 - 3 tsp salt

- cracked black pepper

## Method

1. Add the olive oil to a large pot over medium heat.

3. Once the oil starts to heat up, add the onion and cook for a couple of minutes then add the garlic. Continue to cook until the onions become soft (approx 5 minutes).

5. Add the green beans and a big pinch of salt. Mix well and let the beans cook for 10 minutes (until they get a bit softer).

7. Add the tomatoes and mix well again. Let it cook for a couple of minutes then add the tomato paste, cinnamon and salt. Mix well and continue to cook until the liquid at the bottom starts to simmer.

9. Turn the heat to low, cover and let it cook for 1 hour or until the beans are tender and delicious (yes, I ate a few as I went haha). Check on them from time to time - it should be simmering/gently boiling but not vigorously boiling. If it's getting dry at the bottom, you can add a tiny bit of water when needed.

11. When it's done, add some freshly cracked pepper and check the salt - add more if needed. Enjoy with toasted pita bread or my delicious [mujadara](https://shalveena.com/2022/12/30/mujadara-lentils-bulgur-pilaf/) - a perfect match for the tangy, sweet beans.
