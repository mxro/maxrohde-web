title: Reflections and Resolutions
---

Its that time of the year - the end of a year and beginning of another. As 2012 comes to an end, 2013 is just around the corner, and each of us can enter it with new resolve, new motivations and new energy. To make this year better than the last.  

  

I like to take this time to reflect on my journey in 2012 and make resolutions for the beginning of a whole new journey in 2013. 

  

But before I go into that, I want to look at my previous post: [Early start to New Year resolutions](http://www.shalveena.com/2012/12/early-start-to-new-year-resolutions.html). I set 13 goals for 2013, beginning this month. The goal for this month was to do yoga 5 days a week, anytime, for any length of time. Following on from this post, however, there was a guest post by Max: [The Power of Questions](http://www.shalveena.com/2012/12/the-power-of-questions.html) which encouraged asking questions to inspire and get us thinking about the big things in life - about goals, purpose of life. 

  

I decided to give this a go and through asking questions about my own life, my goals, purpose, things that matter, things that stress and worry me, I found that yoga is maybe not the best thing for me to practice to achieve my goals. So instead, I plan to focus on other things (more to come on that later) through 2013. 

  

**Reflections of 2012:**

  

The Good

  

Travelling - to Europe, Fiji and Hamilton. Great fun. 

During the first half of the year, I also started to exercise (and actually kept it up for a couple of months).

Dabbled in yoga, attended few pilates classes, bollywood dance classes and even tried hip hop. Even going to these classes and trying them out is quite an achievement for me as a few years ago I would not even have had the courage to go that far. 

Learnt a bit of German and some Hindi.

Started writing this blog - amazing!

  

The Bad

  

I did not do as much yoga, meditation, exercise, etc as I would have liked to.

Also, unfortunately, I still haven't managed to set up any sort of routine for any of the above.

I feel like I could put much more effort into my blog and writing. Find a direction. Write about my travels.

Did not put enough time and effort to learn German properly! 

Need to really start learning proper Hindi (an Indian who can't write in any Indian language and can only speak broken Hindi - not impressive :P )

  

**Resolutions for 2013:**

\- Be able to carry a conversation in German and read simple sentences.

\- Be able to read Hindi

\- Meditate regularly

\- \*Try\* yoga/pilates

\- Exercise regularly

\- Drink more water

\- Eat more veges and less meat

\- Eat more fruits

\- Finish writing about my travels up to and including end of 2012

\- Keep a daily journal
