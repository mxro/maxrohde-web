In the last post I mentioned that the challenge for this month is to do yoga 5 days a week. However, going to yoga classes is out of the question for me - I know myself well enough to know that I will not be able to keep that up, at least not with my current schedule (and to be honest I may not have enough motivation to do so!). So instead, I will set up to do some yoga at home, 5 days a week. There are heaps of yoga videos, blogs and instructors accessible on the web.  

  

  

Here are a few that I plan to use:

  

[AM/PM Yoga for Beginners by Barbara Benagh](http://www.amazon.com/AM-Yoga-Beginners-Barbara-Benagh/dp/B000UUX2P0)

[AM and PM Yoga for Beginners by Elena Brower](http://www.amazon.com/Element-Am-PM-Yoga-Beginners/dp/B001AYWY68)

Varios videos from [My Yoga Online](http://www.myyogaonline.com/). These guys have a promotion going on which gives new members 25 days of unlimited yoga videos and a free program :)Â 

  

Here is the yoga routine that I tried today:

Please note that I am not trying to promote the above videos or products, and neither do I receive any incentives from any third parties to do so; I have just been browsing around the web for the last few months (and most of 2012) and came across these that I quite enjoyed :)
