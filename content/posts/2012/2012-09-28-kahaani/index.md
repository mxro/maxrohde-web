Kahaani is a suspense/thriller with Vidya Balan in the lead female role. As expected, she is very convincing in her role. I quite like her as an actress - she is versatile and she does not play the typical giddy, happy go lucky Indian female.

The movie starts off well and drew me in - I wanted to find out the story of this woman who's husband seems to have gone missing without a clue. It was especially interesting to see the strength of this pregnant woman who comes to India without knowing the country or anyone there, and who goes to all lengths to locate her missing husband.

What was disappointing, however was when the movie started to introduce elements of national security and terrorists - it seemed like the directors ran out of ideas or couldn't solve the mastery themselves so took the old terrorism route.

Great acting from Vidya Balan and the police officer but the story could be better.

Released: 2012 Cast: Vidya Balan, Parambrata Chatterjee Director: Sujoy Ghosh
