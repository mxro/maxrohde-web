title: What is Amazon Flourish (for AWS)
---

According to a [recent article on the New Stack Blog](http://thenewstack.io/amazon-debuts-flourish-runtime-application-model-serverless-computing/), the Amazon Serverless Team (responsible for instance for [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/details/)) is about to release a new open source product called 'Floruish'.

Currently, there are very few details available on this product. These are some points I could find:

- It will be a platform to **manage components of serverless applications**.
- This includesÂ **versioning lambda functions** and **packaging lambda functions** with other components such as database dependencies.
- It will be **open source** (under Apache license)

As more details become available, I will update this post.

For now, here are some related resources regarding serverless applications with Amazon:
