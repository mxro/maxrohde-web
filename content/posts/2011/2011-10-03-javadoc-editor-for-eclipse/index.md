title: JavaDoc Editor for eclipse
---

Formatting JavaDoc using plain HTML can be a troublesome and time-intensive experience. Today I installed the [JDocEditor](http://www.certiv.net/projects/jdoceditor.html) plugin for eclipse, which allows editing JavaDoc in eclipse using a small rich text editor.

Here, a quick evaluation, a few screenshots and a little getting started guide.

### Evaluation

Good:

- Free
- Helps to reduce the hassle of dealing with line breaks and paragraphs in JavaDoc
- Allows to compose lists and do simple formatting like using bold and italics

Not so good:

- The editor has no native support for JavaDoc annotations such as @link, â€¦
- The editors handling of line breaks, paragraphs and basically any more sophisticated formatting can be unpredictable at times

Conclusion:

- Good tool to enhance productivity in editing JavaDoc documentation with simple formatting.
