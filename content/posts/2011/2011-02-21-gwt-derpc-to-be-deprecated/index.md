title: GWT deRPC to be Deprecated
---

Direct evaluate Remote Procedure Calls (deRPCs) in GWT seem to be promising approach to transfer objects from server to browser. Rather than encoding objects into a stream of text in a legacy format, deRPC sends objects as JavaScript statements from server to client.

However, after some time of working with it, two important reasons surfaced not to adopt this technology.

**\-1- deRPC does not work very well**

I had a number of issues in using deRPC:

- While my test application ran fine in the hosted mode, _I was not able to get it working deployed as a WAR onto tomcat and jetty_. Debugging with Firebug reveals that the messages send from client to server are identical in hosted mode/deployed but the response send from the server was no JavaScript code in hosted mode (but only in deployed mode â€“ which then was not read correctly by the server). I might of course have configured the whole project incorrectly, but I spent hours on the problem and did not get it fixed.
- The JavaScript generated by the server, which was sent over the wire (when the application was deployed in a servlet container), _seemed to be very verbose_.

**\-2- GWT deRPC is about to be depreacted by the Google GWT team**

"DeRPC was created to help with large object graph serialization; however, DeRPC (NOT GWT-RPC) will likely be deprecated eventually in favor of RequestFactory." ([David Chandler on Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/google-web-toolkit/msg/92ac7dc7fb36d244))
