## Problem

Java lists manage inserted objects based on their equality ([see List JavaDoc](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/List.html)). In some instances, it can be confusing that this equality has a different meaning than an equal _identity_ of objects based on their reference.

This becomes quite apparent in the following example:

```
final List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
```

Here, we would usually expect "1" as result, since the String s2 has been inserted after the String s1 (which should have the index 0). However, Java prints "**0**" as answer in above example. 0 is returned since the indexOf(â€¦) method only attempts to find an object which is equal to the passed parameter ("one") and not the identical object to the passed object (s2).

## Solution

Use the IdentityArrayList below:

```java

public class IdentityArrayList<E> extends ArrayList<E> {

@Override
public boolean remove(final Object o) {
return super.remove(this.indexOf(o)) != null;
}

@Override
public boolean contains(final Object o) {
return indexOf(o) >= 0;
}

@Override
public int indexOf(final Object o) {
for (int i = 0; i < size(); i++)
if (o == get(i))
return i;
return -1;
}

@Override
public int lastIndexOf(final Object o) {
for (int i = size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
if (o == get(i))
return i;
return -1;
}

public IdentityArrayList() {
super();
}

public IdentityArrayList(final Collection<? extends E> c) {
super(c);
}

public IdentityArrayList(final int initialCapacity) {
super(initialCapacity);
}

}

```

There are a number of further implementation of List and Set in Java, which consider the object identity rather than the object equality:

[IdentityArrayList part of the Sun/Oracle JDK at sun.awt.util (on java2s.com)](http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Modules-sun/awt/sun/awt/util/IdentityArrayList.java.htm)

[IdentitySet by Sebastian Thomschke (on grepcode.net)](http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.sf.oval/oval/1.20/net/sf/oval/internal/util/IdentitySet.java)

But please note that these lists are not part of the Java JRE. Lists are often critical parts of an application (in terms of performance and reliability). Therefore, the best advice might be to tried to work around scenarios as given above, for instance by assigning unique identifiers to objects.

For HashMaps, however, a special implementation utilizing object identity rather than equality checks is provided in the JRE:

[IdentityHashMap JRE 1.5.0 Java Doc](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/IdentityHashMap.html)
